 Stephen,

 "There is no restriction on modifications and derived works" on the work I
 did for the openldap server as long as this is consistent with the openldap
 license. Please forward this email to Kurt so he does the appropriate
 changes to the files to reflect this.

 Steven,
 .
 The OpenLDAP Foundation believes it the Regents' statement grants a
 license to redistribute derived works and is confident that the University,
 who is quite aware of our actions (as they actively participate in them),
 does not consider our actions to infringe on their rights.  You are
 welcomed to your opinions. I suggest, however, that before you rely
 on your or other people's opinions (including ours), that you consult
 with a lawyer familiar with applicable law and the particulars of your
 situation.
 .
 The Foundation sees no reason for it to expend its limited resources
 seeking clarifications which it believes are unnecessary.  You are,
 of course, welcomed to expend time and energy seeking clarifications
 you think are necessary.  I suggest you contact University's general
 counsel office (http://www.umich.edu/~vpgc/).
 .
 Regards, Kurt
