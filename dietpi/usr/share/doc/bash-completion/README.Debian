bash-completion for Debian
--------------------------

 Completions are kept in /usr/share/bash-completion/completions.

 If a package installs its completion files under /etc/bash_completion.d/,
 bash-completion is still able to use them, but bash-completion itself does
 not install any files under that directory.

 If you are a package maintainer, you are encouraged to use
 dh_bash-completion(1), which will take care of installing third-party
 completions into the appropriate directory.
