Comment: Clause 3 has been deleted:
 July 22, 1999
 .
 To All Licensees, Distributors of Any Version of BSD:
 .
 As you know, certain of the Berkeley Software Distribution ("BSD") source
 code files require that further distributions of products containing all or
 portions of the software, acknowledge within their advertising materials
 that such products contain software developed by UC Berkeley and its
 contributors.
 .
 Specifically, the provision reads:
 .
 "     * 3. All advertising materials mentioning features or use of this software
       *    must display the following acknowledgement:
       *    This product includes software developed by the University of
       *    California, Berkeley and its contributors."
 .
 Effective immediately, licensees and distributors are no longer required to
 include the acknowledgement within advertising materials.  Accordingly, the
 foregoing paragraph of those BSD Unix files containing it is hereby deleted
 in its entirety.
