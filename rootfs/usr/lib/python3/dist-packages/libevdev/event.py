    Represents one input event of type struct input_event as defined in
    ``linux/input.h`` and returned by ``libevdev_next_event()``.

    Comparison between events can be done via the :func:`matches()` function
    or by comparing two input events. Two events match when their most
    precise attribute match and all other attributes are None::

        >>> e = InputEvent(libevdev.EV_REL.REL_X, value=1)
        >>> e == InputEvent(libevdev.EV_REL)
        True

        True
        >>> e == InputEvent(libevdev.EV_REL.REL_Y)
        False
        >>> e == InputEvent(libevdev.EV_REL.REL_X, value=1)
