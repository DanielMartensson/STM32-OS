TODO for adduser
----------------

For adduser 3.x there is to do:

 * make adduser also work with super and in taint mode (fix #214546)
 * Use --msgid-bugs-address when using po4a in debian/rules
 * Address lintian's "untranslatable debconf template"
   This is triggered by adduser/title, which is not intended for translation.
   The suggestion in the lintian output is to state "for internal use only" as part of the description, but this isn't the case; it's just a name.

 * The SETGID_HOME configuration option is deprecated,
   as of bookworm+1.  Run-time warnings should be added
   to notify users of the change; the feature is slated
   for removal in bookworm+3.

 * The --add_extra_groups configuration option is deprecated,
   as of bookworm+1.  Run-time warnings should be added
   to notify users of the change; the feature is slated
   for removal in bookworm+2.

 * The --force-badname command line is deprecated as of bookworm+1.
   Run-time warnings shold be added to notify users of the change;
   the feature is slated for removal in bookworm+2.

 * get rid of --no-preserve-root, refuse removing the root account in any case

 * define meaningful return values, document them

 * remove interactive stuff ("enter group name to remove")

 * discuss users_group default

 * streamline .conf options (/yes, 1, no, 0, true, false)

 * see whether users is default in too many places
