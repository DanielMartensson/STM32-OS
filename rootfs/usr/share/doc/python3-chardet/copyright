Comment: The files in the test suite have mostly no detailed copyright
 information since years. Also some usage conditions might be problematic
 for some kind of users. The upstream issue tracker did get some entries
 about that problem.

 The test files are collected by the upstream project over time from random
 places, some files which are clearly not DFSG compatible getting removed
 from the repackaged tarball for Debian.
