 PREAMBLE
 .
 The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate
 worldwide development of collaborative font projects,
 to support the font creation efforts
 of academic and linguistic communities,
 and to provide a free and open framework
 in which fonts may be shared and improved
 in partnership with others.
 .
 The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied,
 modified and redistributed freely
 as long as they are not sold by themselves.
 The fonts, including any derivative works,
 can be bundled, embedded,
 redistributed and/or sold with any software
 provided that any reserved names are not used
 by derivative works.
 The fonts and derivatives, however,
 cannot be released under any other type of license.
 The requirement for fonts to remain under this license
 does not apply to any document
 created using the fonts or their derivatives.
 .
 DEFINITIONS
 .
 "Font Software" refers to the set of files
 released by the Copyright Holder(s) under this license
 and clearly marked as such.
 This may include source files, build scripts and documentation.
 .
 "Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such
 after the copyright statement(s).
 .
 "Original Version" refers to the collection
 of Font Software components
 as distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).
 .
 "Modified Version" refers to any derivative
 made by adding to, deleting, or substituting --
 in part or in whole --
 any of the components of the Original Version,
 by changing formats
 or by porting the Font Software to a new environment.
 .
 "Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer,
 technical writer or other person
 who contributed to the Font Software.
 .
 PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
 .
 Permission is hereby granted, free of charge,
 to any person obtaining a copy of the Font Software,
 to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify, redistribute,
 and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font Software,
 subject to the following conditions:
 .
 1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
 in Original or Modified Versions,
 may be sold by itself.
 .
 2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software
 may be bundled, redistributed and/or sold with any software,
 provided that each copy contains the above copyright notice
 and this license.
 These can be included either as stand-alone text files,
 human-readable headers or in the appropriate
 machine-readable metadata fields within text or binary files
 as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.
 .
 3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use
 the Reserved Font Name(s)
 unless explicit written permission is granted
 by the corresponding Copyright Holder.
 This restriction only applies to the primary font name
 as presented to the users.
 .
 4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s)
 or the Author(s) of the Font Software
 shall not be used to promote,
 endorse or advertise any Modified Version,
 except to acknowledge the contribution(s)
 of the Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s)
 or with their explicit written permission.
 .
 5) The Font Software,
 modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
 must be distributed entirely under this license,
 and must not be distributed under any other license.
 The requirement for fonts to remain under this license
 does not apply to any document
 created using the Font Software.

 Affirmation and Waiver
 .
 The person who has associated a work with this document (the "Work")
 affirms that he or she (the "Affirmer") is the/an author or owner of
 the Work. The Work may be any work of authorship, including a database.
 .
 The Affirmer hereby fully, permanently and irrevocably waives and
 relinquishes all of her or his copyright and related or neighboring
 legal rights in the Work available under any federal or state law,
 treaty or contract, including but not limited to moral rights, publicity
 and privacy rights, rights protecting against unfair competition and
 any rights protecting the extraction, dissemination and reuse of data,
 whether such rights are present or future, vested or contingent (the
 "Waiver"). The Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of the public
 at large and to the detriment of the Affirmer's heirs or successors.
 .
 The Affirmer understands and intends that the Waiver has the effect of
 eliminating and entirely removing from the Affirmer's control all the
 copyright and related or neighboring legal rights previously held by the
 Affirmer in the Work, to that extent making the Work freely available
 to the public for any and all uses and purposes without restriction of
 any kind, including commercial use and uses in media and formats or by
 methods that have not yet been invented or conceived. Should the Waiver
 for any reason be judged legally ineffective in any jurisdiction,
 the Affirmer hereby grants a free, full, permanent, irrevocable,
 nonexclusive and worldwide license for all her or his copyright and
 related or neighboring legal rights in the Work.
 .
 The Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not
 a party to the Waiver and has no duty or obligation with respect to
 the Waiver or use of the Work.
