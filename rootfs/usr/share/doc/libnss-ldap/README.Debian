libnss-ldap for Debian
----------------------

This package was compiled against OpenLDAP and provides an excellent way
of merging LDAP into an NIS network.
An example for /etc/nsswitch.conf is installed in
/usr/share/doc/libnss-ldap/examples/nsswitch.ldap. 

 -- Configuration files --

The configuration file will be changed if the first line of configuration says
###DEBCONF### there is a note about this in debconf when the package is first
installed. 

the debconf configuration should be fairly safe in any case, it only changes
the entries it asks about, nothing else.

 -- Sami Haahtinen <ressu@debian.org>


Ubuntu uses /etc/ldap.conf as libnss-ldap's configuration file and
/etc/ldap.secret as the file to store the password of the rootbinddn.

See LDAP-Permissions.txt for details about the required LDAP permissions.
