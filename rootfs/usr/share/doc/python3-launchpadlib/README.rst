Overview
========

launchpadlib is a standalone Python library for scripting Launchpad through
its web services interface.  It is the officially supported bindings to the
Launchpad web service, but there may be third party bindings that provide
scriptability for other languages.

Launchpad (http://launchpad.net) is a a free software hosting and development
website, making it easy to collaborate across multiple projects. For
information on Launchpad itself, see

    https://help.launchpad.net

More information on the Launchpad web service, such as user guides and
reference documentation, are available at

Credential storage
==================

After authorizing an application to access Launchpad on a user's behalf,
launchpadlib will attempt to store those credentials in the most
system-appropriate way.  That is, on Gnome it will store them in the Gnome
keyring, on KDE it will store them in the KDE wallet or optionally it may try
to store them on disk (filename will be obtained from ``LP_CREDENTIALS_FILE``
environment variable if not specified in script).
