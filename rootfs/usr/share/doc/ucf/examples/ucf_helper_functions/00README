ucf_helper_functions
====================

This directory contains a suggestion for code to help using
ucf covering most of the real-life use cases. This code is in use 
since many months in the aide package and seems to work "well enough".

See aide-common's maintainer scripts for usage examples. The package ships the
current version of all config files in /usr/share/aide-common/config, and
handles all of them in a single call of handle_all_ucf_files
/usr/share/aide-common/config /etc. The code expects that the first parameter
of handle_all_ucf_files is a pointer to the directory structure, and
handle_all_ucf_files rebuilds that structure in the target directory. See the
aide-common package for reference.

This directory also contains a test suite so that the correct behavior of the
function can be verified. Call ./testsuite as root. Sorry, the test suite
needs root privileges and uses the ucf database of the host system. The test
cases are kind of documented in the test-list file.
