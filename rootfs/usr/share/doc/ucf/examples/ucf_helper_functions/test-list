the column ucfr says how many files should be registered (check_ucfq_number)
after the second ucf run. Tests do also check this.

(*) the second ucf call causes a question to be asked while that it not
strictly necessary. Since both options yield the same result, and this is an
exotic corner case, we can live with that.
