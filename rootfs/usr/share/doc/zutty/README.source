zutty for Debian
----------------

Source uses waf for building, therefore source package is repackaged
from git master branch using the “debian/repackage.sh” script.

While repackaging the “vtscript.gz” compressed file in test directory
has been kept because it's used as-is by the test scripts and
uncompressing it would require further modification of source.
