                Information about the net-tools package

NET-TOOLS	A collection of programs that form the base set of the
		NET-3 networking distribution for the Linux operating
		system.

This package includes the important tools for controlling the network
subsystem of the Linux kernel.  This includes arp, hostname, ifconfig,
netstat, rarp and route.  Additionally, this package contains
utilities relating to particular network hardware types (plipconfig,
slattach, mii-tool) and advanced aspects of IP configuration (iptunnel,
ipmaddr).

Please include the output of "program --version" when reporting bugs.

                          Notes
                          -----

This is net-tools 2.10.

These have largely been tested against Linux kernels 2.6+.  They might work
against older ones if anyone actually still cares about those anymore.

They have largely been tested against recent glibc versions, but should work
on any POSIX compliant C library.  If you notice portability issues, please
flie a bug for us (or even send a patch!).

The NLS support by Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo <acme@conectiva.com.br> uses GNU
gettext.  Translations to Brazilian Portuguese (pt_BR), German (de), Estonian
(ee), Czech (cz), and French (fr) are available.  Others are welcome!

route/netstat -r do not yet support different address families cleanly.
IPX/DDP/AX25 people, please feel free to add the code.
