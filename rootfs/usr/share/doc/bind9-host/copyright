Comment:
 The BIND 9 project was originally distributed under permissive
 ISC licence.  The license on the majority of the files has been
 changed to MPL-2.0 in the BIND 9.11 release.  However, while the
 majority of the files are licenced under MPL-2.0, there are files
 where the portions were contributed to ISC by third parties under
 different license.  It would serve no useful purpose to duplicate
 copyright information from every file with a different licence, so
 this copyright block is just amalgamate of all copyright holders
 and licenses used in the BIND 9 project. You need to look at the
 individual files to get the specific license that covers that file.
