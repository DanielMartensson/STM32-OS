Reporting missing or buggy detection

* Suggested bug severities

  - Missing detection (just 'data'), or enhancements: wishlist
  - Mis-detection: normal
  - Regressions: important
  - Overall correct detection, but with some glitches: minor

* Reproducers

It's crucial to test whether a detection works as expected, or why it
fails. So please provide something suitable: Attach a short sample, or
send an information where to find it. As a last resort, provide a hex
dump of the first 256 bytes. Your package maintainer will ask for more
if necessary. Double-check this file neither contains sensitive data
nor infringes a copyright.

* File format descriptions

For any file types not detected yet: Pointers to documents that
describe the file format are a great help, too.
