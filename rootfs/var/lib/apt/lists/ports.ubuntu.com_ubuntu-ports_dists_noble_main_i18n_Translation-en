     2. Random Character Password Generation Algorithm with 35
        configurable modes of operation
  * Configurable password length parameters
  * Configurable amount of generated passwords
  * Ability to initialize RNG with user string
  * Support for /dev/random
  * Ability to crypt() generated passwords and print them as additional output.
  * Special parameters to use APG in script
  * Ability to log password generation requests for network version
  * Ability to control APG service access using tcpd
  * Ability to use password generation service from any type of box (Mac,
    WinXX, etc.) that connected to network
  * Ability to enforce remote users to use only allowed type of password
    generation
 The client/server version of apg has been deliberately omitted.
 .
 Please note that there are security flaws in pronounceable
 password generation schemes (see Ganesan / Davis "A New Attack on
 Random Pronounceable Password Generators", in "Proceedings of the 17th

Package: backuppc
Description-md5: b6f406334b3551715e06ad0d1f9cbb05
Description-en: high-performance, enterprise-grade system for backing up PCs
 BackupPC is disk based and not tape based. This particularity allows
 features not found in any other backup solution:
 .
  * Clever pooling scheme minimizes disk storage and disk I/O.
    Identical files across multiple backups of the same or different PC are
    stored only once resulting in substantial savings in disk storage and disk
    writes. Also known as "data deduplication".
  * Optional compression provides additional reductions in storage.
    CPU impact of compression is low since only new files (those not already
    in the pool) need to be compressed.
  * A powerful http/cgi user interface allows administrators to view log files,
    configuration, current status and allows users to initiate and cancel
    backups and browse and restore files from backups very quickly.
  * No client-side software is needed. On WinXX the smb protocol is used.
    On Linux or Unix clients, rsync or tar (over ssh/rsh/nfs) can be used
  * Flexible restore options. Single files can be downloaded from any backup
    directly from the CGI interface. Zip or Tar archives for selected files
    or directories can also be downloaded from the CGI interface.
  * BackupPC supports mobile environments where laptops are only intermittently
    connected to the network and have dynamic IP addresses (DHCP).
  * Flexible configuration parameters allow multiple backups to be performed
    in parallel.
  * and more to discover in the manual...
 .
 If you intent to backup Linux/Unix/macOS hosts, you'll typically need
 the recommended packages backup-rsync and openssh-client installed on
 the server side and the normal rsync package on the client side.
 .
 A less performant alternative is using tar over SSH instead of rsync,
 e.g. in case of rsync server/client protocol incompatibilities.
 .
 If you intent to backup Windows hosts, you'll typically need the
 recommended package smbclient installed.
 .
 There is also the possibility to backup Windows hosts over SSH and
 rsync or tar if you have an SSH daemon installed on the Windows host,
 e.g. via Cygwin or Windows subsystem for Linux (WSL). In that case
 the same packages as with Linux/Unix/macOS are needed.

Package: backuppc-rsync
Description-md5: fe2a5ada10b1f4a924327d9694186ade
Description-en: patched rsync for BackupPC version 4
 rsync-bpc (as it is called upstream) is a patched variant of rsync
 that has been developed specifically for server-side use with
 BackupPC (https://github.com/backuppc/backuppc) version 4. It extends
 the normal rsync so that it understands BackupPC 4's internal data
 structures on disk and can directly write to it.
 .
 You do neither need to use nor to install this package manually. It
 is pulled in as dependency where needed.
 .
 It is also no problem to install it in parallel with the normal rsync
 as it does not install any binary in the common search path ($PATH),
 just in a dedicated directory under /usr/libexec/.
 .
 In terms of functionality it replaces the less performant Perl module
 File::RsyncP (package libfile-rsyncp-perl) which was used by BackupPC
 version 3 on the server side.

Package: busybox-static
Description-md5: 1ccce12e08e4aa13a2e6bdd5ffb85b65
Description-en: Standalone rescue shell with tons of builtin utilities
 BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single
 small executable. It provides minimalist replacements for the most common
 utilities you would usually find on your desktop system (i.e., ls, cp, mv,
 mount, tar, etc.).  The utilities in BusyBox generally have fewer options than
 their full-featured GNU cousins; however, the options that are included
 provide the expected functionality and behave very much like their GNU
 counterparts.
 .
 busybox-static provides you with a statically linked simple stand alone shell
 that provides all the utilities available in BusyBox. This package is
 intended to be used as a rescue shell, in the event that you screw up your
 system. Invoke "busybox sh" and you have a standalone shell ready to save
 your system from certain destruction. Invoke "busybox", and it will list the
 available builtin commands.

Package: busybox-syslogd
Description-md5: 6d204aacbcadc9711030ab99f904ca3b
Description-en: Provides syslogd and klogd using busybox
 The system log daemon is responsible for providing logging of
 messages received from programs and facilities on the local host as
 well as from remote hosts.
 .
 The kernel log daemon listens to kernel message sources and is
 responsible for prioritizing and processing operating system
 messages.
 .
 The busybox implementation of the syslogd is particular useful on
 embedded, diskless (netboot) or flash disk based systems because it
 can use a fixed size ring buffer for logging instead of saving logs
 to the disk or sending it to remote logging servers. The ring buffer
 can be read using the (also busybox based) command logread.
 .
 This package provides the glue to the busybox syslogd and klogd to be
 used in the system by providing the appropriate symbolic links and
 scripts.

 isolated systems, the user can periodically enter the correct time by
 hand (using 'chronyc'). In either case 'chronyd' determines the rate
 at which the computer gains or loses time, and compensates for this.
 Chronyd implements the NTP protocol and can act as either a client or
 a server.

 Cloud-init will identify the cloud it is running on during boot, read any
 provided metadata from the cloud and initialize the system accordingly. This
 may involve setting up the network and storage devices to configuring SSH
 access key and many other aspects of a system. Later on the cloud-init will
 also parse and process any optional user or vendor data that was passed to

    completely integrated with gdb in order to be able to display
    formatted kernel data structures, disassemble source code, etc.
 .
 o  The current set of available commands consist of common kernel core
    analysis tools such as a context-specific stack traces, source code
    disassembly, kernel variable displays, memory display, dumps of
    linked-lists, etc.  In addition, any gdb command may be entered,
    which in turn will be passed onto the gdb module for execution.
 .
 o  There are several commands that delve deeper into specific kernel
    subsystems, which also serve as templates for kernel developers
    to create new commands for analysis of a specific area of interest.
    Adding a new command is a simple affair, and a quick recompile
    adds it to the command menu.
 .
 o  The intent is to make the tool independent of Linux version dependencies,
    building in recognition of major kernel code changes so as to adapt to
    new kernel versions, while maintaining backwards compatibility.

Package: dbus
Description-md5: 7c48e5e44b120f1b0ed0784fa95d28b4
Description-en: simple interprocess messaging system (system message bus)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus
 decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be
 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
 XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.
 .
 It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.
 .
 This package provides a fully-functional D-Bus system bus with activation
 support, used for communication between system services, and depends on
 most of the other components of the reference implementation of D-Bus.
 .

Package: dbus-user-session
Description-md5: be4453093922af92deac14b4e8458a83
Description-en: simple interprocess messaging system (systemd --user integration)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 On systemd systems, this package opts in to the session model in which
 a user's session starts the first time they log in, and does not end
 until all their login sessions have ended. This model merges all
 parallel non-graphical login sessions (text mode, ssh, cron, etc.), and up
 to one graphical session, into a single "user-session" or "super-session"
 within which all background D-Bus services are shared.
 .
 Multiple graphical sessions per user are not currently supported in this
 mode; as a result, it is particularly suitable for gdm, which responds to
 requests to open a parallel graphical session by switching to the existing
 graphical session and unlocking it.
 .
 To retain dbus' traditional session semantics, in which login sessions
 are artificially isolated from each other, remove this package and install
 dbus-x11 instead.
 .

    bash-specific constructs.
  - cowpoke: upload a Debian source package to a cowbuilder host and build it,
    optionally also signing and uploading the result to an incoming queue.
    [ssh-client]
  - cvs-debi, cvs-debc: wrappers around debi and debc respectively (see below)
    which allow them to be called from the CVS working directory.
    [cvs-buildpackage]
  - cvs-debrelease: wrapper around debrelease which allows it to be called
    from the CVS working directory. [cvs-buildpackage, dupload | dput,
    ssh-client]

  - debbisect: bisect snapshot.debian.org to find which change in the archive
    introduced a certain problem. [mmdebstrap, python3-debian]
  - debc: List contents of current package.  Do this after a successful
    "debuild" to see if the package looks all right.
  - debchange (abbreviation dch): Modifies debian/changelog and manages version
    numbers for you.  It will either increment the version number or add an
    entry for the current version, depending upon the options given to it.
    [libdistro-info-perl, libsoap-lite-perl]*
  - debcheckout: checkout the development repository of a Debian package. *
  - debclean: Clean a Debian source tree.  Debclean will clean all Debian
    source trees below the current directory, and if requested, also remove
    all files that were generated from these source trees (that is .deb, .dsc
    and .changes files).  It will keep the .diffs and original files, though,
    so that the binaries and other files can be rebuilt if necessary. *
  - debcommit: Commits changes to cvs, darcs, svn, svk, tla, bzr, git, or hg,
    using new entries in debian/changelog as the commit message. Also supports

  - debdiff-apply: Apply unified diffs of two Debian source packages, such as
    those generated by debdiff, to a target Debian source package. Any changes
    to debian/changelog are dealt with specially, to avoid the conflicts that

    that old patches still apply to newer versions of those packages.
    [python3-debian, python3-unidiff, quilt]
  - debi: Installs the current package by using dpkg.  It assumes that the
    current package has just been built (for example by debuild), and the .deb
    lives in the parent directory, and will effectively run dpkg -i on the .deb.
    The ability to install the package with a very short command is very
    useful when troubleshooting packages.
  - debootsnap: Combines debootstrap and snapshot.debian.org to create a chroot
    containing exactly the requested selection of packages. This can be used
    to re-create a chroot from the past, for example to reproduce a bug. The
    tool is also used by debrebuild to build a package in a chroot with build
    dependencies in the same version as recorded in the buildinfo file.
    [apt-utils, dpkg-dev, equivs, mmdebstrap, python3-pycurl]

    build a given source directory twice, with a set of variation between the
    first and second build, and compare the binary packages produced. If
    diffoscope is installed, it is used to compare non-matching binaries. If
    disorderfs is installed, it is used during the build to inject
    non-determinism in filesystem listing operations.
    [faketime, diffoscope, disorderfs]
  - debrsign: This transfers a .changes/.dsc pair to a remote machine for
    signing, and runs debsign on the remote machine over an SSH connection.
    [gnupg | gnupg2, debian-keyring, ssh-client]
  - debsign: Use GNU Privacy Guard to sign the changes (and possibly dsc)
    files created by running dpkg-buildpackage with no-sign options.  Useful
    if you are building a package on a remote machine and wish to sign it on

    .changes and .dsc files from a remote machine. [gnupg |gnupg2,
    debian-keyring, ssh-client]*
  - debsnap: grab packages from https://snapshot.debian.org [libwww-perl,
    libjson-perl]
  - debuild: A wrapper for building a package (i.e., dpkg-buildpackage) to
    avoid problems with insufficient permissions and wrong paths etc.

Package: dh-strip-nondeterminism
Description-md5: 8d263bf649295a9e610e1397553155b8
Description-en: file non-deterministic information stripper — Debhelper add-on
 StripNondeterminism is a library for stripping non-deterministic information
 such as timestamps and filesystem ordering from various file and archive
 formats.
 .
 This can be used as a post-processing step to improve the reproducibility of a
 build product, when the build process itself cannot be made deterministic.
 .
 It is used as part of the Reproducible Builds project, although it should be
 considered a temporary workaround which should not be needed in the long
 term; upstream software should be reproducible even without using such a tool.
 .
 This package installs the ‘dh_strip_nondeterminism’ Debhelper command that
 strips nondeterminism as part of a Debian package build process.

 accessed through the network.
 .
 The DICT Development Group maintains several public servers which can
 be accessed from any machine connected to the Internet.  The default
 configuration is to query one of these servers first. This may be
 changed in the configuration file /etc/dictd/dict.conf.
 .
 Queries may be customized by numerous command line options, including
 specifying the database(s) to be queried and the search strategy to
 be used.
 .
 This package also provides dictl, which allows using UTF-8 encoded dictionaries
 with terminals that do not support UTF-8.

 in two directories.  `cmp' shows the offsets and line numbers where
 two files differ.  `cmp' can also show all the characters that
 differ between the two files, side by side.  `diff3' shows differences
 among three files.  `sdiff' merges two files interactively.
 .
 The set of differences produced by `diff' can be used to distribute
 updates to text files (such as program source code) to other people.
 This method is especially useful when the differences are small compared
 to the complete files.  Given `diff' output, the `patch' program can
 update, or "patch", a copy of the file.

Package: eatmydata
Description-md5: 4dad1280628a46c312954a4d1ba76a96
Description-en: Library and utilities designed to disable fsync and friends
 This package contains a small LD_PRELOAD library (libeatmydata) and a couple
 of helper utilities designed to transparently disable fsync and friends (like
 open(O_SYNC)). This has two side-effects: making software that writes data
 safely to disk a lot quicker and making this software no longer crash safe.
 .
 You will find eatmydata useful if particular software calls fsync(), sync()
 etc. frequently but the data it stores is not that valuable to you and you may
 afford losing it in case of system crash. Data-to-disk synchronization calls
 are typically very slow on modern file systems and their extensive usage might
 slow down software significantly. It does not make sense to accept such a hit
 in performance if data being manipulated is not very important.
 .
 On the other hand, do not use eatmydata when you care about what software
 stores or it manipulates important components of your system. The library is
 called libEAT-MY-DATA for a reason.

Description-md5: eecadd6e89bb6f575d54f8f256a154aa
Description-en: Circumvent Debian package dependencies
 This package provides a tool to create trivial Debian packages.
 Typically these packages contain only dependency information, but they
 can also include normal installed files like other packages do.
 .
 One use for this is to create a metapackage: a package whose sole
 purpose is to declare dependencies and conflicts on other packages so
 that these will be automatically installed, upgraded, or removed.
 .
 Another use is to circumvent dependency checking: by letting dpkg
 think a particular package name and version is installed when it
 isn't, you can work around bugs in other packages' dependencies.
 (Please do still file such bugs, though.)

Package: fonts-sil-nuosusil
Description-md5: 8cde22bffdb6ea3933fc18ad7b7a0b46
Description-en: Unicode font for Yi (a script used in southwestern China)
 The Nuosu SIL font was originally named SIL Yi and developed in 2000
 as a single Unicode font for the standardized Yi script used by a
 large ethnic group in southwestern China.
 .
 The traditional Yi scripts have been in use for centuries, and have a
 tremendous number of local variants. The script was standardized in the
 1970's by the Chinese government. In the process of standardization, 820
 symbols from the traditional scripts of the Liangshan region were chosen
 to form a syllabary.
 .
 The syllable inventory of a speech variety from Xide County, Sichuan
 was used as the phonological basis for standardization. For the most part
 there is one symbol per phonologically-distinct syllable and vice-versa.
 The direction of writing and reading was standardized as left-to-right.
 Punctuation symbols were borrowed from Chinese, and a diacritic was
 incorporated into the system to mark one of the tones.
 .
 One font from this typeface family is included in this release:
  * Nuosu SIL Regular

Package: fonts-sil-scheherazade
Description-md5: 0c6246880e4da91928734d7d2d2cad86
Description-en: smart Unicode font for Arabic
 Scheherazade, named after the heroine of the classic Arabian Nights
 tale, is designed in a similar style to traditional typefaces such as
 Monotype Naskh, extended to cover the full Unicode Arabic repertoire.
 .
 The goal for this product was to provide a single Unicode-based font
 family that would contain a comprehensive inventory of glyphs needed
 for almost any Arabic-based writing system. This font makes use of
 state-of-the-art font technologies to support complex typographic
 issues.
 .
 This font provides a simplified rendering of Arabic script, using
 basic connecting glyphs but not including a wide variety of additional
 ligatures or contextual alternates (only the required lam-alef
 ligatures). This simplified style is often preferred for clarity,
 especially in non-Arabic languages, but may be considered unattractive
 in more traditional and literate communities.
 .
 One font from this typeface family is included in this release:
     - Scheherazade Regular
 .
 This release supports virtually all of the Unicode 5.0 Arabic
 character repertoire (excluding the Arabic Presentation Forms blocks,
 which are not recommended for normal use). Font smarts are implemented
 using OpenType technology.
 Webfont versions and HTML/CSS examples are also available.

Package: gamemode
Description-md5: 1b71909bcf1af74aa9dbd9253b8b1eac
Description-en: Optimise Linux system performance on demand
 GameMode is a daemon/lib combo for Linux that allows games to request a set
 of optimisations be temporarily applied to the host OS.
 .
 The design has a clear-cut abstraction between the host daemon and library
 (gamemoded and libgamemode), and the client loaders (libgamemodeauto and
 gamemode_client.h) that allows for safe use without worrying about whether
 the daemon is installed or running. This design also means that while the
 host library currently relies on systemd for exchanging messages with the
 daemon, it's entirely possible to implement other internals that still work
 with the same clients.
 .
 GameMode was designed primarily as a stop-gap solution to problems with
 the Intel and AMD CPU powersave or ondemand governors, but is intended to
 be expanded beyond just CPU governor states, as there are a wealth of
 automation tasks one might want to apply.
 .
 This package is a metapackage including everything that is necessary to run
 gamemode-enabled games or to enable it by hand for applications. It includes
 a program called '/usr/games/gamemoderun', which can invoke gamemode into any
 application. It also includes '/usr/games/gamemode-simulate-game', which
 invokes gamemode, sleeps for 10 seconds and then exits. This allows you to
 test whether gamemode is working properly on your system, it will return
 gamemode's error message if something went wrong, otherwise it will exit with
 a 0 status.

 talking to fingerprint reading devices, and processing fingerprint data.

 data can be used in several different use cases, for example
 automatic code generation for bindings, API verification and documentation
 generation.
 .
 GObject Introspection contains tools to generate and handle the

 and the libgirepository-1.0 library, it does not guarantee to provide the
 library itself (currently it does provide the libgirepository-1.0.so
 symlink as a workaround for a Meson issue, but this should not be
 relied on). Packages that explicitly link to libgirepository-1.0.so,
 mainly dynamic language bindings like GJS and PyGIi, will need to
 build-depend on libgirepository-1.0-dev in addition to this package.

Package: gpgv
Description-md5: 4ea8f4f4d6a0a387a4a3aeba3e6cc888
Description-en: GNU privacy guard - signature verification tool
 GnuPG is GNU's tool for secure communication and data storage.
 .
 gpgv is actually a stripped-down version of gpg which is only able
 to check signatures. It is somewhat smaller than the fully-blown gpg
 and uses a different (and simpler) way to check that the public keys
 used to make the signature are valid. There are no configuration
 files and only a few options are implemented.

Package: gpsd
Description-md5: f4c594224d3953b094b99b3ab4e1fa72
Description-en: Global Positioning System - daemon
 The gpsd service daemon can monitor one or more GPS devices connected to
 a host computer, making all data on the location and movements of the
 sensors available to be queried on TCP port 2947.
 .
 With gpsd, multiple GPS client applications can share access to devices
 without contention or loss of data. Also, gpsd responds to queries with a
 format that is substantially easier to parse than the different standards
 emitted by GPS devices.
 .
 This also includes common tools ubxtool and gpsctl for device configuration
 of the local hardware as well as a ntpshmmon to check generated refclock data.

 access a GPS device.

Package: grep
Description-md5: f9188c5583d41955f3b3fe60b9d445f1
Description-en: GNU grep, egrep and fgrep
 'grep' is a utility to search for text in files; it can be used from the
 command line or in scripts.  Even if you don't want to use it, other packages
 on your system probably will.
 .
 The GNU family of grep utilities may be the "fastest grep in the west".
 GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about
 twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper
 search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being
 considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to
 look at every character. The result is typically many times faster
 than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing backreferencing
 will run more slowly, however.)

Description-en: ICC color profiles for use with color profile aware software
 Color management allows controlled conversion between color representation of
 input and output devices and color spaces. ICC profiles are an important part
 of color management. They are data files that represent mappings between the
 input or output color space of a particular device and the device-agnostic
 profile connection space (PCS) in accordance with the standards set by the
 International Color Consortium (ICC). This package contains a number of high
 quality ICC color profiles for use with color profile aware software such as
 Scribus, Gimp, CinePaint, Krita, or Digikam. In general this package is
 useful if the software using it was built against a color management support
 library such as liblcms1 or liblcms2-2. In some software such as Scribus you
 have to explicitly enable color managemenent in the preferences to be able to
 use these profiles. The sampleicc-tools package contains tools that can be
 used to manipulate and query the icc profiles in Debian.
 .
 The color profiles in this package are available under free software licenses.
 Additional profiles under non-free licenses are available in the icc-profiles
 package.

Description-en: development files for MIT Kerberos without Heimdal conflict
 Kerberos is a system for authenticating users and services on a network.
 Kerberos is a trusted third-party service.  That means that there is a
 third party (the Kerberos server) that is trusted by all the entities on
 the network (users and services, usually called "principals").

 /usr/lib/mit-krb5 and can be installed along side heimdal-multidev, which

Description-md5: a4340506ec33e727d20a43b185d30cc6
Description-en: Sophisticated command-line FTP/HTTP/BitTorrent client programs
 Lftp is a file retrieving tool that supports FTP, HTTP, FISH, SFTP, HTTPS,
 FTPS and BitTorrent protocols under both IPv4 and IPv6. Lftp has an amazing
 set of features, while preserving its interface as simple and easy as possible.
 .
 The main two advantages over other ftp clients are reliability and ability
 to perform tasks in background. It will reconnect and reget the file being
 transferred if the connection broke. You can start a transfer in background
 and continue browsing on the ftp site. It does this all in one process. When
 you have started background jobs and feel you are done, you can just exit
 lftp and it automatically moves to nohup mode and completes the transfers.
 It has also such nice features as reput and mirror. It can also download a
 file as soon as possible by using several connections at the same time.
 .
 Lftp can also be scriptable, it can be used to mirror sites, it lets you
 copy files among remote servers (even between FTP and HTTP). It has an
 extensive online help. It supports bookmarks, and connecting to several
 ftp/http sites at the same time.
 .
 This package also includes lftpget - A simple non-interactive
 tool for downloading files.

 Algorithm::Diff is a Perl module that allows users to analyze text based on a
 Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) algorithm. It can compare two files and find
 the differences between them, which can produce the same information as the
 common Unix tool 'diff'.
 .
 There is an XS-optimized implementation of the core loop, which accelerates
 some types of diff output (see libalgorithm-diff-xs-perl).

 excellent but not very well-known Algorithm::LCS module, with a drop-in
 interface identical to Algorithm::Diff.

 Note that only the LCSidx function is optimized in XS at the moment, which
 means only compact_diff will get significantly faster for large data sets,

Package: libapache2-reload-perl
Description-md5: 9133f4572c0362fca02856e42bb7d655
Description-en: module for reloading Perl modules when changed on disk
 Apache2::Reload reloads modules that change on the disk.
 .
 When Perl pulls a file via "require", it stores the filename in the global
 hash %INC. The next time Perl tries to "require" the same file, it sees the
 file in %INC and does not reload from disk. This module's handler can be
 configured to iterate over the modules in %INC and reload those that have
 changed on disk. It can also monitor only specific modules that have
 registered themselves with Apache2::Reload. It is possible to trigger the
 check only when a special touch-file has been modified, minimizing the number
 of stat() calls per request.

 libblockdev is a C library with GObject introspection support that can be used
 for doing low-level operations with block devices like setting up LVM, BTRFS,

 The library uses plugins (LVM, BTRFS,...) and serves as a thin wrapper around
 its plugins' functionality. All the plugins, however, can be used as
 standalone libraries. One of the core principles of libblockdev is that it is
 stateless from the storage configuration's perspective (e.g. it has no
 information about VGs when creating an LV).

 constraints required for coordinating multiple threads through atomic
 variables. It implements the interface as defined by the C++11
 standard, but makes this feature available for platforms lacking
 system/compiler support for this particular C++11 feature.
 .
 Users of this library should already be familiar with concurrency in
 general, as well as elementary concepts such as "mutual exclusion".

 The implementation makes use of processor-specific instructions where
 possible (via inline assembler, platform libraries or compiler
 intrinsics), and falls back to "emulating" atomic operations through
 locking.

Description-en: C++ representation of time duration, time point, and clocks
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 The Boost.Chrono library provides:
 .
  * A means to represent time durations: managed by the generic
 duration class . Examples of time durations include days, minutes,
 seconds and nanoseconds, which can be represented with a fixed number
 of clock ticks per unit. All of these units of time duration are
 united with a generic interface by the duration facility.
  * A type for representing points in time: time_point. A time_point
 represents an epoch plus or minus a duration. The library leaves
 epochs unspecified. A time_point is associated with a clock.
  * Several clocks, some of which may not be available on a
 particular platform: system_clock, steady_clock and
 high_resolution_clock. A clock is a pairing of a time_point and
 duration, and a function which returns a time_point representing now.
 .
 To make the timing facilities more generally useful, Boost.Chrono
 provides a number of clocks that are thin wrappers around the
 operating system's time APIs, thereby allowing the extraction of wall
 clock time, user CPU time, system CPU time spent by the process:
 .
  * process_real_cpu_clock, captures wall clock CPU time spent by the
 current process.
  * process_user_cpu_clock, captures user-CPU time
 spent by the current process.
  * process_system_cpu_clock, captures
 system-CPU time spent by the current process.
  * A tuple-like class
 process_cpu_clock, that captures real, user-CPU, and system-CPU
 process times together.
  * A thread_clock thread steady clock giving
 the time spent by the current thread (when supported by a platform).
 .
 Lastly, Boost.Chrono includes typeof registration for duration and
 time_point to permit using emulated auto with C++03 compilers.

 Boost.Context is a foundational library that provides a sort of
 cooperative multitasking on a single thread. By providing an
 abstraction of the current execution state in the current thread,
 including the stack (with local variables) and stack pointer, all
 registers and CPU flags, and the instruction pointer, a fcontext_t
 instance represents a specific point in the application's execution

 coroutines, cooperative threads (userland threads) or an equivalent
 to C# keyword yield in C++.

Package: libclass-xsaccessor-perl
Description-md5: e785abcf076fde905048821573ca8b98
Description-en: Perl module providing fast XS accessors
 Class::XSAccessor implements fast XS accessors both for getting at and setting
 an object attribute. Additionally, the module supports mutators and simple
 predicates like those for testing the truth value of a variable. It works only
 with objects that are implemented as ordinary hashes.
 .
 The XS accessor methods were between 1.6 and 2.5 times faster than typical
 pure-perl accessors in some simple benchmarking. If you usually write clear
 code, a factor of two speed-up is a good estimate.
 .
 Refer to Class::XSAccessor::Array (also included in libclass-xsaccessor-perl)

 .
 It is faster (although less flexible) than Storable's dclone. Its
 functionality is _not_ serializing in-memory objects (i.e. as
 Data::Dumper or YAML::Dump do), but deep-copying them over to new
 in-memory structures.

Description-en: custom op checking attached to subroutines
 Devel::CallChecker makes some new features of the Perl 5.14.0 C API
 available to XS modules running on older versions of Perl.
 The features are centred around the function cv_set_call_checker,
 which allows XS code to attach a magical annotation
 to a Perl subroutine,
 resulting in resolvable calls to that subroutine
 being mutated at compile time by arbitrary C code.
 This module makes cv_set_call_checker
 and several supporting functions available.
 (It is possible to achieve the effect of cv_set_call_checker
 from XS code on much earlier Perl versions,
 but it is painful to achieve without the centralised facility.)

Package: libdigest-bubblebabble-perl
Description-md5: 53d3feb819fdf5fe359a87daa35fb618
Description-en: perl module to create bubble-babble fingerprints
 Digest::BubbleBabble takes a message digest (generated by
 either of the MD5 or SHA-1 message digest algorithms) and creates
 a fingerprint of that digest in "bubble babble" format.
 Bubble babble is a method of representing a message digest
 as a string of "real" words, to make the fingerprint easier
 to remember. The "words" are not necessarily real words, but
 they look more like words than a string of hex characters.
 .
 Bubble babble fingerprinting is used by the SSH2 suite
 (and, consequently, by Net::SSH::Perl, the Perl SSH
 implementation) to display easy-to-remember key fingerprints.
 The key (a DSA or RSA key) is converted into a textual form,
 digested using Digest::SHA, and run through bubblebabble
 to create the key fingerprint.

Package: libencode-locale-perl
Description-md5: 56ab0dbfeb69a085703b46539790f388
Description-en: utility to determine the locale encoding
 In many applications it's wise to let Perl use Unicode for the strings it
 processes. Most of the interfaces Perl has to the outside world are still byte
 based. Programs therefore need to decode byte strings that enter the program
 from the outside and encode them again on the way out.
 .
 The POSIX locale system is used to specify both the language conventions
 requested by the user and the preferred character set to consume and output.
 The Encode::Locale module looks up the charset and encoding (called a CODESET

Description-en: Perl module for error/exception handling in an OO-ish way
 The Error module provides two interfaces.  Firstly "Error" provides a
 procedural interface to exception handling. Secondly "Error" is a base class
 for errors/exceptions that can either be thrown, for subsequent catch, or can
 simply be recorded.
 .
 Errors in the class "Error" should not be thrown directly, but the user
 should throw errors from a sub-class of "Error".
 .
 Warning: Using the "Error" module is no longer recommended due to the
 black-magical nature of its syntactic sugar, which often tends to break. Its
 maintainers have stopped actively writing code that uses it, and discourage
 people from doing so.
 .
 Recommended alternatives are Exception::Class (libexception-class-perl),
 Error::Exception (not packaged), TryCatch (libtrycatch-perl), and Try::Tiny
 (libtry-tiny-perl).

Description-md5: 7a8f47713a14d4cffef04ea1071c8eaa
Description-en: file non-deterministic information stripper — Perl module
 StripNondeterminism is a library for stripping non-deterministic information
 such as timestamps and filesystem ordering from various file and archive
 formats.
 .
 This can be used as a post-processing step to improve the reproducibility of a
 build product, when the build process itself cannot be made deterministic.
 .
 It is used as part of the Reproducible Builds project, although it should be
 considered a temporary workaround which should not be needed in the long
 term; upstream software should be reproducible even without using such a tool.
 .

 searches directories of a user's PATH (as returned by File::Spec)
 looking for executable files matching a given name.
 .
 On Debian /usr/bin/which is guaranteed to be available, but going
 through the Perl implementation can still save a fork.

 information. This is a Unix only distribution. If you want to gather
 this information for Unix and Windows, use Filesys::DfPortable.  The
 only major benefit of using Filesys::Df over Filesys::DfPortable, is
 that Filesys::Df supports the use of open filehandles as arguments.

Package: libgamemode0
Description-md5: 4a3f53bb67dec0937d51dc0baa1dee10
Description-en: Optimise Linux system performance on demand (host library)
 GameMode is a daemon/lib combo for Linux that allows games to request a set
 of optimisations be temporarily applied to the host OS.
 .
 The design has a clear-cut abstraction between the host daemon and library
 (gamemoded and libgamemode), and the client loaders (libgamemodeauto and
 gamemode_client.h) that allows for safe use without worrying about whether
 the daemon is installed or running. This design also means that while the
 host library currently relies on systemd for exchanging messages with the
 daemon, it's entirely possible to implement other internals that still work
 with the same clients.
 .
 GameMode was designed primarily as a stop-gap solution to problems with
 the Intel and AMD CPU powersave or ondemand governors, but is intended to
 be expanded beyond just CPU governor states, as there are a wealth of
 automation tasks one might want to apply.
 .
 This package provides the host library for gamemode. It is an internal
 library which communicates with the daemon.

 w-bit words and is termed GF(2^w). As such, the elements of a Galois Field are
 the integers 0, 1, . . ., 2^w − 1. Galois Field arithmetic defines addition
 and multiplication over these closed sets of integers in such a way that they
 work as you would hope they would work. Specifically, every number has a
 unique multiplicative inverse. Moreover, there is a value, typically the value
 2, which has the property that you can enumerate all of the non-zero elements
 of the field by taking that value to successively higher powers.

 HTML::Template attempts to make using HTML templates simple and
 natural. It extends standard HTML with the pseudo tags <TMPL_VAR>,
 <TMPL_LOOP>, <TMPL_INCLUDE>, <TMPL_IF> and <TMPL_ELSE>. These are used
 to implement some basic logic - variable substitution, loops,
 conditional branches - inside the HTML template, while leaving the more
 complex computations to separate Perl code. This keeps the template
 accessible for designers and other non-Perl people, without limiting
 the programmer.

 Cookies are a general mechanism which server side connections can use to both
 store and retrieve information on the client side of the connection. For more
 information about cookies refer to
 <URL:http://curl.haxx.se/rfc/cookie_spec.html> and
 <URL:http://www.cookiecentral.com/>. HTTP::Cookies also implements the new
 style cookies described in RFC 2965. The two variants of cookies are supposed
 to be able to coexist happily.
 .
 Instances of the class HTTP::Cookies are able to store a collection of
 Set-Cookie2: and Set-Cookie: headers and are able to use this information to
 initialize Cookie-headers in HTTP::Request objects. The state of a
 HTTP::Cookies object can be saved in and restored from files.

Package: libhttp-daemon-perl
Description-md5: bc18d58f587125ce15970c9f9291eaa7
Description-en: simple http server class
 Instances of the HTTP::Daemon class are HTTP/1.1 servers that listen on a
 socket for incoming requests. The HTTP::Daemon is a subclass of
 IO::Socket::IP, so you can perform socket operations directly on it too.
 .
 The accept() method will return when a connection from a client is available.
 The returned value will be an HTTP::Daemon::ClientConn object which is
 another IO::Socket::IP subclass. Calling the get_request() method on this
 object will read data from the client and return an HTTP::Request object. The
 ClientConn object also provide methods to send back various responses.
 .
 This HTTP daemon does not fork(2) for you. Your application, i.e. the user of
 the HTTP::Daemon is responsible for forking if that is desirable. Also note
 that the user is responsible for generating responses that conform to the
 HTTP/1.1 protocol.

Package: libibverbs1
Description-md5: 8cdb9c883867c94335417ed5085d7667
Description-en: Library for direct userspace use of RDMA (InfiniBand/iWARP)
 libibverbs is a library that allows userspace processes to use RDMA
 "verbs" as described in the InfiniBand Architecture Specification and
 the RDMA Protocol Verbs Specification.  iWARP ethernet NICs support
 RDMA over hardware-offloaded TCP/IP, while InfiniBand is a
 high-throughput, low-latency networking technology.  InfiniBand host
 channel adapters (HCAs) and iWARP NICs commonly support direct
 hardware access from userspace (kernel bypass), and libibverbs
 supports this when available.
 .
 For this library to be useful, a device-specific plug-in module
 should also be installed.

Package: libimport-into-perl
Description-md5: 8a817802dc5924f984c4c4e341e15361
Description-en: module for importing packages into other packages
 Import::Into creates a global method import::into which you can call on
 any package to import it into another package. This is useful because
 there are many different ways to write exporters: some use Exporter, some
 use Sub::Exporter, some use Moose::Exporter, some use Exporter::Declare
 and some things are pragmas.
 .
 And if you want to re-export other things, you have to know which is which.
 Exporter subclasses provide export_to_level, but if they overrode their
 import method all bets are off. Sub::Exporter provides an into parameter
 but figuring out something used it isn't trivial. Pragmas need to have
 their import method called directly since they affect the current unit of
 compilation. Import::Into can be used to import packages into other packages
 without having to deal with the specific details of every exporting approach.

 When enabled (or disabled as some may prefer to say, since you actually turn
 it on by calling no indirect), the indirect pragma lexically warns about
 indirect object syntax constructs that may have slipped into your code. This
 syntax is now considered harmful, since its parsing has many quirks and its
 use is error prone (when swoosh isn't defined, swoosh $x actually compiles to
 $x->swoosh).

 It currently does not warn for core functions (print, say, exec or system).
 This may change in the future, or may be added as optional features that
 would be enabled by passing options to unimport.

Package: libiterator-perl
Description-md5: a3ef55e7213c2e92174f560f32dfef6b
Description-en: Perl implementation of iterators
 Iterator is meant to be the definitive implementation of iterators, as
 popularized by Mark Jason Dominus's lectures and recent book (Higher Order
 Perl, Morgan Kauffman, 2005).
 .
 An "iterator" is an object, represented as a code block that generates the
 "next value" of a sequence, and generally implemented as a closure. When you
 need a value to operate on, you pull it from the iterator. If it depends on
 other iterators, it pulls values from them when it needs to. Iterators can be
 chained together (see Iterator::Util for functions that help you do just
 that), queueing up work to be done but not actually doing it until a value is
 needed at the front end of the chain. At that time, one data value is pulled
 through the chain.

Description-en: HTTPS driver for LWP::UserAgent
 The LWP::Protocol::https module provides support for using HTTPS schemed URLs
 with LWP. LWP::Protocol::https is a plug-in to the LWP protocol handling, so
 you don't use it directly. Once the module is installed LWP is able to access
 sites using HTTP over SSL/TLS.
 .
 If hostname verification is requested by LWP::UserAgent's ssl_opts, and
 neither SSL_ca_file nor SSL_ca_path is set, then SSL_ca_file is implied to be
 the one provided by ca-certificates.
 .
 This module used to be bundled with libwww-perl, but it was unbundled in
 v6.02 in order to be able to declare its dependencies properly for the CPAN
 tool-chain. Applications that need HTTPS support can just declare their
 dependency on LWP::Protocol::https and will no longer need to know what
 underlying modules to install.

Description-en: Perl module for fast IP address lookups
 Net::Patricia uses a Patricia Trie data structure to quickly
 perform IP address prefix matching for applications such as
 IP subnet, network or routing table lookups.  The data
 structure is based on a radix tree using a radix of two, so
 sometimes you see patricia implementations called "radix" as
 well.  The term "Trie" is derived from the word "retrieval"
 but is pronounced like "try".  Patricia stands for
 "Practical Algorithm to Retrieve Information Coded as
 Alphanumeric", and was first suggested for routing table
 lookups by Van Jacobsen.  Patricia Trie performance
 characteristics are well-known as it has been employed for
 routing table lookups within the BSD kernel since the 4.3

Description-en: Perl module providing SSL support to Net::SMTP
 Net::SMTP::SSL implements the same API as Net::SMTP, but uses IO::Socket::SSL
 for its network operations. Due to the nature of Net::SMTP's new method, it is
 not overridden to make use of a default port for the SMTPS service. Perhaps
 future versions will be smart like that. Port 465 is usually what you want,

 Nettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit easily in more or
 less any context: In crypto toolkits for object-oriented languages (C++,
 Python, Pike, ...), in applications like LSH or GNUPG, or even in kernel
 space.

 It tries to solve a problem of providing a common set of cryptographic
 algorithms for higher-level applications by implementing a
 context-independent set of cryptographic algorithms. In that light, Nettle
 doesn't do any memory allocation or I/O, it simply provides the
 cryptographic algorithms for the application to use in any environment and
 in any way it needs.

Description-en: Layout and rendering of internationalized text
 Pango is a library for layout and rendering of text, with an emphasis
 on internationalization. Pango can be used anywhere that text layout is
 needed. however, most of the work on Pango-1.0 was done using the GTK+
 widget toolkit as a test platform. Pango forms the core of text and
 font handling for GTK+-2.0.
 .
 Pango is designed to be modular; the core Pango layout can be used with
 four different font backends:
  - Core X windowing system fonts
  - Client-side fonts on X using the Xft library
  - Direct rendering of scalable fonts using the FreeType library
  - Native fonts on Microsoft backends

Description-en: Perl module for argument type classification
 Params::Classify provides various type-testing functions. These are intended
 for functions that, unlike most Perl code, care what type of data they
 are operating on. For example, some functions wish to behave
 differently depending on the type of their arguments (like overloaded
 functions in C++).
 .
 These functions only provide type classification; they do not enforce
 type restrictions. Type enforcement may, of course, be built using
 these classification functions, but the reader's attention is drawn to
 libparams-validate-perl.

Package: libpath-iterator-rule-perl
Description-md5: b636b9ad652b05a3e8bffbc091f23b93
Description-en: iterative, recursive file finder
 Path::Iterator::Rule iterates over files and directories
 to identify ones matching a user-defined set of rules.
 The API is based heavily on File::Find::Rule,
 but with more explicit distinction between matching rules
 and options that influence how directories are searched.
 A Path::Iterator::Rule object is a collection of rules (match criteria)
 with methods to add additional criteria.
 Options that control directory traversal are given as arguments
 to the method that generates an iterator.
 .
 Here is a summary of features
 for comparison to other file finding modules:
  * provides many "helper" methods for specifying rules
  * offers (lazy) iterator and flattened list interfaces
  * custom rules implemented with callbacks
  * breadth-first (default) or pre- or post-order depth-first searching
  * follows symlinks (by default, but can be disabled)
  * directories visited only once (no infinite loop; can be disabled)
  * doesn't chdir during operation
  * provides an API for extensions
 .
 As a convenience, the PIR module is an empty subclass of this one
 that is less arduous to type for one-liners.

 enumerating available token certificates, or selecting a certificate
 directly by serialized id, handling card removal and card insert
 events, handling card re-insert to a different slot, supporting session
 expiration and much more all using a simple API.
 .
 libpkcs11-helper is not designed to manage card content, since object
 attributes are usually vendor specific, and 99% of application need to
 access existing objects in order to perform signature and decryption.

 either by lookup in %INC or by assuming it is $0 if the caller is
 "main" (or it can't find %INC{caller()})

Description-en: modules for parsing/translating POD format documents
 This package contains the following mdoules for using Perl5 "pod" (Plain Old
 Documentation).
 .
 "Pod::Parser", which provides a base class for parsing and selecting sections
 of POD documentation from an input stream.
 .
 "Pod::Select", which provides a subclass of Pod::Parser and an exported
 function named "podselect()" to dump selected sections of raw pod
 documentation from an input stream.
 .
 "Pod::PlainText", which is a replacement for "Pod::Text" and the
 corresponding "pod2text()" function. It is derived from the Pod::Parser
 class. As of perl 5.00_58, Pod::PlainText has been re-written by Russ
 Allbery, and has been renamed to Pod::Text in the core Perl distribution
 (replacing the previous implementation of Pod::Text). The Pod::PlainText
 module is still provided with Pod::Parser solely for backward
 compatibility.
 .
 "Pod::InputObjects": Some input objects needed by Pod::Parser, and for
 advanced users of Pod::Parser that need more about a command besides its name
 and text.
 .
 "Pod::ParseUtils", a module with several object-oriented helpers for POD
 parsing and processing. Probably the most important is Pod::Hyperlink for
 parsing and expanding POD hyperlinks L<...>.
 .
 This distribution is considered to be legacy - it has been superseded by
 Pod::Simple which brings more robustness, unicode and various other benefits.
 It has been removed from perl core after 5.31.0, and is packaged only for
 backward compatibility.

 single-threaded. libpthread-stubs supports this behavior even on
 platforms which do not supply all the necessary pthread stubs.

Package: libre-engine-re2-perl

Description-en: RE2 regex engine
 re::engine::RE2 replaces perl's regex engine
 in a given lexical scope with RE2.
 .
 RE2 is a primarily DFA based regexp engine from Google
 that is very fast at matching large amounts of text.
 However it does not support look behind
 and some other Perl regular expression features.
 See RE2's syntax wiki page
 at <https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax> for more information.
 .
 Fallback to normal Perl regexp is implemented by this module.
 If RE2 is unable to compile a regexp it will use Perl instead,
 therefore features not implemented by RE2 don't suddenly stop working,
 they will just use Perl's regexp implementation.

Package: libre2-10
Description-md5: fa4436c464caac5a165cb52db8665092
Description-en: efficient, principled regular expression library
 RE2 is a fast, safe, thread-friendly alternative to backtracking regular
 expression engines like those used in PCRE, Perl, and Python. It is a C++
 library.
 .
 RE2 uses automata theory to guarantee that regular expression searches run in
 time linear in the size of the input. RE2 implements memory limits, so that
 searches can be constrained to a fixed amount of memory. RE2 is engineered to
 use a small fixed C++ stack footprint no matter what inputs or regular
 expressions it must process; thus RE2 is useful in multithreaded environments
 where thread stacks cannot grow arbitrarily large.
 .
 On large inputs, RE2 is often much faster than backtracking engines; its use
 of automata theory lets it apply optimizations that the others cannot.

Package: librole-tiny-perl
Description-md5: f585057ac20f867b96ff923f664661ee
Description-en: Perl module for minimalist role composition
 Role::Tiny is a Perl module to do minimalist role composition. Role composition
 can be thought of as much more clever and meaningful multiple inheritance.
 .
 The basics of this implementation of roles is:
  * If a method is already defined on a class, that method will not be composed
    in from the role.
  * If a method that the role "requires" to be implemented is not implemented,
    role application will fail loudly.
 .
 Unlike Class::C3, where the last class inherited from "wins", role composition
 is the other way around, where first wins. In a more complete system (see
 Moose) roles are checked to see if they clash. The goal of this is to be much
 simpler, hence disallowing composition of multiple roles at once.

Description-md5: fe6fbb765aaa7a88266b0069a816480a
Description-en: Perl module for sorting of revision (and similar) numbers
 The Sort::Versions module allows easy sorting (via comparisons) of mixed text
 and numeric strings, similar to the complex "version numbers" that many
 revision control packages and shared library systems use. For an explanation
 of the algorithm, it's easiest to look at these examples:
 .
  1.1   <  1.2
  1.1a  <  1.2
  1.1   <  1.1.1
  1.1   <  1.1a
  1.1.a <  1.1a
  1     <  a
  a     <  b
  1     <  2
 .
  (special handling for leading zeros)
  0002  <  1
  1.06  <  1.5
 .
  (a hyphen binds looser than a period)
  1-1 < 1-2
  1-2 < 1.2

 in syntactic and semantic details.  Its design is oriented toward
 concerns of "programming in the large", that is, of creating and
 maintaining boundaries - both abstract and operational - that
 preserve large-system integrity, availability and concurrency.
 .
 It supports a mixture of imperative procedural, concurrent actor,
 object-oriented and pure functional styles.  Rust also supports
 generic programming and meta-programming, in both static and dynamic
 styles.
 .
 This package contains the standard Rust libraries, built as dylibs,
 needed to run dynamically-linked Rust programs (-C prefer-dynamic).

Description-en: sophisticated exporter for custom-built routines
 When you use a perl module, first it is "required" function used, then its
 import method is called.
 .
 Sub::Exporter provides a sophisticated alternative to Exporter.pm.  It allows
 for renaming, currying/sub-generation etc.
 .
 Sub::Exporter builds a custom exporter which can then be installed into your
 module. It builds this method based on configuration passed to its
 setup_exporter method.

Package: libsub-exporter-progressive-perl
Description-md5: 854d6f3825a72a536574faf14f5c2cdf
Description-en: module for using Sub::Exporter only if needed
 Sub::Exporter is an incredibly powerful module, but with that power comes
 great responsibility, as well as some runtime penalties.
 Sub::Exporter::Progressive is a Sub::Exporter wrapper that will let your
 users just use Exporter if all they are doing is picking exports, but use
 Sub::Exporter if your users try to use Sub::Exporter's more advanced
 features, like renaming exports.
 .
 Note that this module will export @EXPORT and @EXPORT_OK package variables
 for Exporter to work. Additionally, if your package uses advanced
 Sub::Exporter features like currying, this module will only use
 Sub::Exporter, so you might as well use it directly.

Package: libsub-identify-perl
Description-md5: 9b4d49af75c72bb6e04434d783ca36ff
Description-en: module to retrieve names of code references
 Sub::Identify allows you to retrieve the real name of code references. For
 this, it uses perl's introspection mechanism, provided by the B module.
 .
 It provides four functions : sub_name returns the name of the
 subroutine (or __ANON__ if it's an anonymous code reference),
 stash_name returns its package, and sub_fullname returns the
 concatenation of the two.
 .
 The fourth function, get_code_info, returns a list of two elements,
 the package and the subroutine name (in case of you want both and are worried
 by the speed.)
 .
 In case of subroutine aliasing, those functions always return the
 original name.

 Sub::Name has only one function, which is also exported by default:
 .
 subname NAME, CODEREF
 .
 Assigns a new name to referenced sub. If package specification is
 omitted in the name, then the current package is used. The return
 value is the sub.
 .
 The name is only used for informative routines (caller, Carp, etc).
 You won't be able to actually invoke the sub by the given name. To
 allow that, you need to do glob-assignment yourself.

Package: libtext-xslate-perl
Description-md5: c96263a9d51761f289a5d0fd6e1ea90c
Description-en: scalable template engine for Perl 5 (C/XS accelerated)
 Text::Xslate is a template engine, tuned for persistent applications, safe
 as an HTML generator, and with rich features.
 .
 There are a lot of template engines in CPAN, for example Template-Toolkit,
 Text::MicroTemplate, HTML::Template, and so on, but all of them have some
 weak points: a full-featured template engine may be slow, while a fast
 template engine may be too simple to use. This is why Text::Xslate is
 developed, which is to be the best template engine for web applications.
 .
 The concept of Text::Xslate is strongly influenced by Text::MicroTemplate and
 Template-Toolkit 2, but the central philosophy of Text::Xslate is different
 from them. That is, the philosophy is one of sandboxing; that the template
 logic should not have no access outside the template beyond your permission.

Description-en: X cursor management library
 Xcursor is a simple library designed to help locate and load cursors for the
 X Window System.  Cursors can be loaded from files or memory and can exist in
 several sizes; the library automatically picks the best size.  When using
 images loaded from files, Xcursor prefers to use the Render extension's
 CreateCursor request for rendering cursors.  Where the Render extension is
 not supported, Xcursor maps the cursor image to a standard X cursor and uses
 the core X protocol CreateCursor request.
 .
 Preferred themes for cursors can be installed if desired, via
 xcursor-themes or other cursor-theme or icon-theme packages,
 configured with update-alternatives --config x-cursor-theme.

Package: libxml-parser-perl
Description-md5: 1d62424e8724202d89f9a9fadad8266e
Description-en: Perl module for parsing XML files
 The XML::Parser module provides ways to parse XML documents.  It is built on
 top of XML::Parser::Expat, which is a lower level interface to James Clark's
 expat library. Each call to one of the parsing methods creates a new instance
 of XML::Parser::Expat which is then used to parse the document. Expat options
 may be provided when the XML::Parser object is created. These options are
 then passed on to the Expat object on each parse call. They can also be given
 as extra arguments to the parse methods, in which case they override options
 given at XML::Parser creation time.
 .
 The behavior of the parser is controlled either by Style and/or Handlers
 options, or by setHandlers method. These all provide mechanisms for
 XML::Parser to set the handlers needed by XML::Parser::Expat. If neither
 Style nor Handlers are specified, then parsing just checks the document for
 being well-formed.
 .
 When underlying handlers get called, they receive as their first parameter
 the Expat object, not the Parser object.

Package: libxml-sax-base-perl

Description-en: base class for SAX drivers and filters
 XML::SAX::Base is a base class for PerlSAX drivers and filters.  The main
 advantages that it provides are easy dispatching of events the right way (ie
 it takes care for you of checking that the handler has implemented that
 method, or has defined an AUTOLOAD), and the guarantee that filters will pass
 along events that they aren't implementing to handlers downstream that might
 nevertheless be interested in them.
 .
 This package also provides XML::SAX::Exception.

 .
 The libxml-sax-expatxs-perl provides an Expat XML parser as an XS module.

Package: libxml-sax-perl
Description-md5: 85b6ca7554a3537b49500d73d818d9b6
Description-en: Perl module for using and building Perl SAX2 XML processors
 XML::SAX consists of several framework classes for using and
 building Perl SAX2 XML parsers, filters, and drivers.  It is designed
 around the need to be able to "plug in" different SAX parsers to an
 application without requiring programmer intervention.  Those of you
 familiar with the DBI will be right at home.  Some of the designs
 come from the Java JAXP specification (SAX part), only without the
 javaness.
 .
 The package also contains a SAX parser, XML::SAX::PurePerl, but it
 is considered too slow for serious use and is only provided as a
 fallback parser. It is recommend XML::SAX::Expat (provided in
 libxml-sax-expat-perl) instead.
 .
 The framework includes a Debian-specific script (called
 update-perl-sax-parsers) to manage the ParserDetails.ini file. This
 script is intended to be used in postinst and prerm package scripts to
 (de)register parsers.  See README.Debian for more info.

Package: libxml-simple-perl
Description-md5: a230ee1ac2e536e0222ff87d14fe8eaf
Description-en: Perl module for reading and writing XML
 The XML::Simple module provides a simple API layer on top of an underlying
 XML parsing module to maintain XML files (especially configuration
 files).  Two functions are exported: XMLin() and XMLout().
 .
 The simplest approach is to call these two functions directly, but an
 optional object oriented interface allows them to be called as
 methods of an XML::Simple object.  The object interface can also be
 used at either end of a SAX pipeline.
 .
 Note from upstream: The use of this module in new code is strongly
 discouraged. Other modules are available which provide more straightforward
 and consistent interfaces. In particular, XML::LibXML is highly recommended.
 XML::Twig is another excellent alternative.These modules are packaged as
 libxml-libxml-perl and libxml-twig-perl in Debian.

Package: libxml-twig-perl
Description-md5: fffca4420a292dabc4b6e8d1d74cca5d
Description-en: Perl module for processing huge XML documents in tree mode
 The XML::Twig module provides a way to process XML documents.  It is built on
 top of XML::Parser.
 .
 The module offers a tree interface to the document, while allowing to
 output the parts of it that have been completely processed.
 .
 It allows minimal resource (CPU and memory) usage by building the
 tree only for the parts of the documents that need actual processing,
 through the use of the twig_roots and twig_print_outside_roots
 options.  The finish and finish_print methods also help to increase
 performance.
 .
 XML::Twig tries to make simple things easy so it tries its best to
 takes care of a lot of the (usually) annoying (but sometimes
 necessary) features that come with XML and XML::Parser.

Package: libxml-xpathengine-perl
Description-md5: a232570871d958cf3696105e6607e9a0
Description-en: re-usable XPath engine for DOM-like trees
 XML::XPathEngine provides an XPath engine, that can be re-used by other
 module/classes that implement trees.
 .
 In order to use the XPath engine, nodes in the user module need to mimic
 DOM nodes. The degree of similarity between the user tree and a DOM dictates
 how much of the XPath features can be used. A module implementing all of the
 DOM should be able to use this module very easily (you might need to add
 the cmp method on nodes in order to get ordered result sets).
 .
 This module is derived from Matt Sergeant's XML::XPath.

Description-en: save the output of a command in a log file
 The logsave program will execute cmd_prog with the specified
 argument(s), and save a copy of its output to logfile.  If the
 containing directory for logfile does not exist, logsave will
 accumulate the output in memory until it can be written out.  A copy
 of the output will also be written to standard output.

Package: logtail
Description-md5: 3d8e1a3c014f75462f73115b7f7c543a
Description-en: Identify new lines added to the end of log files
 Each time logtail and logtail2 are run on a file they print lines
 added since the last run.
 .
 They can be used by log checkers, such as logcheck, to identify new
 entries in log files.
 .
 This package provides both logtail and logtail2. The latter is better
 suited to log files that may be rotated between runs: if logtail2
 finds that the inode of the file changed, it tries to find the file
 it was rotated from using customisable heuristics. If it finds the
 file, it will new find lines added to the old file as well as to the
 new file.

Package: logwatch
Description-md5: ece539a8a87c5f861d7f0b865e42a03c
Description-en: log analyser with nice output written in Perl
 Logwatch is a modular log analyser that runs every night
 and mails you the results. It can also be run from command line.
 .
 The output is by service and you can limit the output to one particular
 service. The subscripts which are responsible for the output, mostly
 convert the raw log lines in structured format.
 .
 Logwatch generally ignores the time component in the output, that means,
 you will know that the reported event was logged in the requested range of
 time, but you will have to go to the raw log files to get the exact details.

Package: lp-solve
Description-md5: 0cf1973d14c9916f985920235dcabc27
Description-en: Solve (mixed integer) linear programming problems
 The linear programming (LP) problem can be formulated as: Solve A.x >=
 V1, with V2.x maximal. A is a matrix, x is a vector of (nonnegative)
 variables, V1 is a vector called the right hand side, and V2 is a vector
 specifying the objective function.
 .
 An integer linear programming (ILP) problem is an LP with the
 constraint that all the variables are integers.  In a mixed integer
 linear programming (MILP) problem, some of the variables are integer
 and others are real.
 .
 The program lp_solve solves LP, ILP, and MILP problems. It is slightly
 more general than suggested above, in that every row of A (specifying
 one constraint) can have its own (in)equality, <=, >= or =. The result
 specifies values for all variables.
 .
 lp_solve uses the 'Simplex' algorithm and sparse matrix methods for
 pure LP problems.  If one or more of the variables is declared
 integer, the Simplex algorithm is iterated with a branch and bound
 algorithm, until the desired optimal solution is found.  lp_solve can
 read MPS format input files.

Description-en: Portable Archive Interchange (cpio, pax, tar)
 paxtar is an implementation of an archiving utility that reads
 and writes several formats - traditional ones, the extended
 formats specified in IEEE 1003.1, and the ar(5) format used
 by deb(5) packages (MirBSD specific paxtar extension). The
 pax interface was designed by IEEE 1003.2 as a compromise in
 the chronic controversy over which of tar or cpio is best, but
 this implementation offers paxcpio and paxtar for easy calling.
 .
 This is the MirBSD paxtar implementation supporting the formats
 ar, bcpio, cpio, SVR4 cpio with and without CRC, old tar, and
 ustar, but not the format known as pax yet. It has extensions
 for removing non-numerical user and group IDs from the archive,
 storing hardlinked files only once, setting ownership to the
 superuser, anonymising inode and device information, changing
 the mtime to zero, and producing GNU tar compatible trailing
 slashes on ustar directory nodes. Its "ar" format is suitable
 for operating on *.deb files, unlike that of GNU binutils.

 Perl is a highly capable, feature-rich programming language with over
 20 years of development. Perl 5 runs on over 100 platforms from
 portables to mainframes. Perl is suitable for both rapid prototyping
 and large scale development projects.
 .
 Perl 5 supports many programming styles, including procedural,
 functional, and object-oriented. In addition to this, it is supported
 by an ever-growing collection of reusable modules which accelerate
 development. Some of these modules include Web frameworks, database
 integration, networking protocols, and encryption. Perl provides
 interfaces to C and C++ for custom extension development.

 extensive information about the interpreter as it compiles and executes
 a program (see the -D switch in perlrun(1)).
 .
 Note that this package is primarily of use in debugging *Perl* rather

 required if the `perl' package is installed.
 .
 Note that this package only exists to save archive space and should be
 considered an internal implementation detail of the `perl' package.

 This package provides a virtual package "perl-openssl-abi-x" that
 corresponds to the libssl-dev package SONAME it was built against.
 The packages that need to stay compatible with each other can depend
 on this.

Package: pkexec
Description-md5: 220b2dc5fa280403052088b9c3dcca5a
Description-en: run commands as another user with polkit authorization
 polkit is an application-level toolkit for defining and handling the policy
 that allows unprivileged processes to speak to privileged processes.
 It was previously named PolicyKit.
 .
 pkexec is a setuid program to allow certain users to run commands as
 root or as a different user, similar to sudo. Unlike sudo, it carries
 out authentication and authorization by sending a request to polkit,
 so it uses desktop environments' familiar prompting mechanisms for
 authentication and uses polkit policies for authorization decisions.
 .
 By default, members of the 'sudo' Unix group can use pkexec to run any
 command after authenticating. The authorization rules can be changed by
 the local system administrator.
 .
 If this functionality is not required, removing the pkexec package will
 reduce security risk by removing a setuid program.

 helper applications while building a debian binary package:
 .
 pkgstriptranslations removes all *.mo files in /usr/share/locale from
 all package build directories. It is used to strip off gettext translations
 from generated binary packages, because translations are already shipped
 in the language packs.  Its behaviour (which is disabled by default) is
 configured in /etc/pkgbinarymangler/striptranslations.conf.
 .

Package: policykit-1
Description-md5: 2d49933e7dd6c9f9c8a34acc21cd4eb8
Description-en: transitional package for polkitd and pkexec
 polkit is an application-level toolkit for defining and handling the policy
 that allows unprivileged processes to speak to privileged processes.
 It was previously named PolicyKit.
 .
 This transitional package depends on polkitd, the system service used by
 polkit, and pkexec, a setuid program analogous to sudo. They were
 historically packaged together, but have been separated so that users of
 polkitd are not required to install pkexec.

Package: policykit-1-doc

Package: policykit-desktop-privileges
Description-md5: 7c28ca06f75a40f414d7f116ee4df6d2
Description-en: run common desktop actions without password
 This package provides a set of PolicyKit privileges which allow Administrators
 to run common actions without being asked for their password:
 .
  * mounting and checking internal disk drives (through udisks)
  * setting the CPU speed and policy (through the GNOME CPU frequency applet)
  * setting the time and timezone (through the GNOME clock applet or through
    KDE)
  * Update already installed software
  * Configure printers
 .
 It does not change privileges for non-Administrators (users who are not in the
 "sudo" group). So this satisfies the typical desktop/laptop use
 case where the user has full control over the hardware anyway.
 .
 This is implemented by shipping a polkitd set of rules.

Package: policyrcd-script-zg2
Description-md5: 7d7c7ded8bc05abbd5e2982614b87ac3
Description-en: policy-compliant interface from invoke-rc.d to local config files
 This package contains a script which is linked via the alternatives
 subsystem to /usr/sbin/policy-rc.d. This script looks for a local
 policy-rc.d script in /usr/local and /etc, providing a policy- and
 FHS-compliant way to interface invoke-rc.d with a local script.
 .
 Without this package, a local admin wanting to cleanly interface with
 invoke-rc.d is forced to drop a local binary to /usr/sbin and/or
 manually interface with the alternatives system. Both ways of doing
 this are clumsy and error-prone, so this package offers a clean way of
 interfacing with sysvrc and file-rc.
 .
 Since there are at least two packages containing their own version of
 invoke-rc.d, having a search path policy for policy-rc.d can be
 messy and is prone to be unstructured and uncoordinated.
 .
 Hence, having a dedicated package is the clean way of doing things.
 .
 This package has its upstream sources maintained in the Debian
 project, so there is no upstream URL.

Package: polkitd
Description-md5: 9502a7bb99b13ec238a7b4995aa16328
Description-en: framework for managing administrative policies and privileges
 polkit is an application-level toolkit for defining and handling the policy
 that allows unprivileged processes to speak to privileged processes.
 It was previously named PolicyKit.
 .
 It is a framework for centralizing the decision making process with respect to
 granting access to privileged operations for unprivileged (desktop)
 applications.
 .
 In a typical use of polkit, an unprivileged application such as gnome-disks
 sends requests via D-Bus or other inter-process communication mechanisms
 to a privileged system service such as udisks, which asks polkitd for
 permission to process those requests. This allows the application to carry
 out privileged tasks without making use of setuid, which avoids several
 common sources of security vulnerabilities.
 .
 This package provides the polkitd D-Bus service and supporting programs.
 The pkexec program is not included, and can be found in the pkexec package.

Package: pollinate
Description-md5: eff6822748707d1918e5af33c749eb2f
Description-en: seed the pseudo random number generator
 This client will connect to one or more Pollen (entropy-as-a-service)
 servers over an (optionally) encrypted connection and retrieve a random
 seed over HTTP or HTTPS.
 This is particularly useful at the first boot of cloud images and in
 virtual machines, to seed a system's random number generator at
 genesis, and is intended to supplement the /etc/init.d/urandom init script.
 It can be used on physical machines, as well, to supplement the seeding
 of the pseudo random number generator.

 OpenStack consists of multiple projects. Each project, in turn, is composed of
 multiple services. To process some request, e.g. to boot a virtual machine,
 OpenStack uses multiple services from different projects. In the case somethin
 works too slowly, it's extremely complicated to understand what exactly goes
 wrong and to locate the bottleneck.
 .
 To resolve this issue, a tiny but powerful library, osprofiler, has been
 interoduced, and can be used by all OpenStack projects and their Python
 clients. To be able to generate one trace per request, that goes through all
 involved services, and builds a tree of calls (see an example
 http://pavlovic.me/rally/profiler/).

Package: python-pbr-doc
Description-md5: 75f54d1745137bcc0870150f158870a9
Description-en: inject useful and sensible default behaviors into setuptools - doc
 PBR (Python Build Reasonableness) is a library that injects some useful and
 sensible default behaviors into your setuptools run. PBR can:
  * Manage version number based on git revisions and tags (Version file).
  * Generate AUTHORS file from git log
  * Generate ChangeLog from git log
  * Generate Sphinx autodoc stub files for your whole module
  * Store your dependencies in a pip requirements file
  * Use your README file as a long_description
  * Smartly find packages under your root package
 .
 PBR is only mildly configurable. The basic idea is that there's a decent way
 to run things and if you do, you should reap the rewards, because then it's
 simple and repeatable. If you want to do things differently, cool! But you've
 already got the power of Python at your fingertips, so you don't really need
 PBR.
 .
 PBR builds on top of the work that d2to1 started to provide for declarative
 configuration. d2to1 is itself an implementation of the ideas behind
 distutils2. Although distutils2 is now abandoned in favor of work towards PEP
 426 and Metadata 2.0, declarative config is still a great idea and
 specifically important in trying to distribute setup code as a library when
 that library itself will alter how the setup is processed. As Metadata 2.0 and
 other modern Python packaging PEPs come out, PBR aims to support them as
 quickly as possible.
 .

 psycopg is a PostgreSQL database adapter for the Python programming language
 (just like pygresql and popy.) This is version 2, a complete rewrite of the
 original code to provide new-style classes for connection and cursor objects
 and other sweet candies. Like the original, psycopg 2 was written with the
 aim of being very small and fast, and stable as a rock.
 .
 psycopg is different from the other database adapter because it was designed
 for heavily multi-threaded applications that create and destroy lots of
 cursors and make a conspicuous number of concurrent INSERTs or UPDATEs.
 psycopg 2 also provides full asynchronous operations for the really brave
 programmer.

Package: python-stevedore-doc
Description-md5: 444c57c52cc2da122888805b43a54b1a
Description-en: manage dynamic plugins for Python applications - doc
 Python makes loading code dynamically easy, allowing you to configure and
 extend your application by discovering and loading extensions (plugins) at
 runtime. Many applications implement their own library for doing this, using
 __import__ or importlib. stevedore avoids creating yet another extension
 mechanism by building on top of setuptools entry points. The code for managing
 entry points tends to be repetitive, though, so stevedore provides manager
 classes for implementing common patterns for using dynamically loaded
 extensions.

Package: python-swiftclient-doc
Description-md5: 0084b509d64d02182b09ca5a4a938417
Description-en: Client library for Openstack Swift API - doc
 OpenStack Object Storage (code-named Swift) creates redundant, scalable object
 storage using clusters of standardized servers to store petabytes of
 accessible data. It is not a file system or real-time data storage system, but
 rather a long-term storage system for a more permanent type of static data
 that can be retrieved, leveraged, and then updated if necessary. Primary
 examples of data that best fit this type of storage model are virtual machine
 images, photo storage, email storage and backup archiving. Having no central
 "brain" or master point of control provides greater scalability, redundancy
 and permanence.
 .
 Objects are written to multiple hardware devices in the data center, with
 the OpenStack software responsible for ensuring data replication and
 integrity across the cluster. Storage clusters can scale horizontally by
 adding new nodes. Should a node fail, OpenStack works to replicate its
 content from other active nodes. Because OpenStack uses software logic to
 ensure data replication and distribution across different devices,
 inexpensive commodity hard drives and servers can be used in lieu of more
 expensive equipment.
 .
 This package provides a client for the OpenStack Swift API. There's a Python
 API  (the "swiftclient" module), and a command-line script ("swift").
 .

Package: python-wrapt-doc
Description-md5: 1a267afe6a30630c7bf1337b5f2d378e
Description-en: decorators, wrappers and monkey patching. - doc
 The aim of the wrapt module is to provide a transparent object proxy for
 Python, which can be used as the basis for the construction of function
 wrappers and decorator functions.
 .
 The wrapt module focuses very much on correctness. It therefore goes way
 beyond existing mechanisms such as functools.wraps() to ensure that decorators
 preserve introspectability, signatures, type checking abilities etc. The
 decorators that can be constructed using this module will work in far more
 scenarios than typical decorators and provide more predictable and consistent
 behaviour.
 .
 To ensure that the overhead is as minimal as possible, a C extension module is
 used for performance critical components. An automatic fallback to a pure
 Python implementation is also provided where a target system does not have a
 compiler to allow the C extension to be compiled.
 .

Package: python3-dacite
Description-md5: c01a2d0695cfb013fcdb4269a62877e2
Description-en: Simple creation of data classes from dictionaries
 Passing plain dictionaries as a data container between your functions or
 methods isn't a good practice. Of course you can always create your
 custom class instead, but this solution is an overkill if you only want
 to merge a few fields within a single object.
 .
 Fortunately Python has a good solution to this problem - data classes.
 Thanks to `@dataclass` decorator you can easily create a new custom
 type with a list of given fields in a declarative manner. Data classes
 support type hints by design.
 .
 However, even if you are using data classes, you have to create their
 instances somehow. In many such cases, your input is a dictionary - it
 can be a payload from a HTTP request or a raw data from a database. If
 you want to convert those dictionaries into data classes, `dacite` is
 your best friend.
 .
 This library was originally created to simplify creation of type hinted
 data transfer objects (DTO) which can cross the boundaries in the
 application architecture.
 .
 It's important to mention that `dacite` is not a data validation library.
 There are dozens of awesome data validation projects and it doesn't make
 sense to duplicate this functionality within `dacite`. If you want to
 validate your data first, you should combine `dacite` with one of data
 validation library.

Package: python3-hamcrest
Description-md5: 1c795fc421cebf67d28bfa0dad9ad800
Description-en: Hamcrest framework for matcher objects (Python 3)
 PyHamcrest is a framework for writing matcher objects, allowing you to
 declaratively define "match" rules. There are a number of situations where
 matchers are invaluable, such as UI validation, or data filtering, but it is in
 the area of writing flexible tests that matchers are most commonly used. This
 tutorial shows you how to use PyHamcrest for unit testing.
 .
 When writing tests it is sometimes difficult to get the balance right between
 overspecifying the test (and making it brittle to changes), and not specifying
 enough (making the test less valuable since it continues to pass even when the
 thing being tested is broken). Having a tool that allows you to pick out
 precisely the aspect under test and describe the values it should have, to a
 controlled level of precision, helps greatly in writing tests that are
 "just right." Such tests fail when the behavior of the aspect under test
 deviates from the expected behavior, yet continue to pass when minor,
 unrelated changes to the behaviour are made.

  * Fast. While performance is not the primarily target of Jinja2 it’s
    surprisingly fast. The overhead compared to regular Python code was reduced
    to the very minimum.
  * Easy to debug. Jinja2 integrates directly into the Python traceback system
    which allows you to debug Jinja2 templates with regular Python debugging
    helpers.
  * Secure. It’s possible to evaluate untrusted template code if the optional
    sandbox is enabled. This allows Jinja2 to be used as templating language
    for applications where users may modify the template design.

 features and omits some problematic features (those that make it unportable).
 In particular, some new operators such as "|" and "where" are available, and
 parentheses are used for grouping not for callbacks into Python, since with
 these changes the language is not trivially associative. Also, fields may be
 quoted whether or not they are contained in brackets.

 PBR (Python Build Reasonableness) is a library that injects some useful and
 sensible default behaviors into your setuptools run. PBR can:
  * Manage version number based on git revisions and tags (Version file).
  * Generate AUTHORS file from git log
  * Generate ChangeLog from git log
  * Generate Sphinx autodoc stub files for your whole module
  * Store your dependencies in a pip requirements file
  * Use your README file as a long_description
  * Smartly find packages under your root package
 .
 PBR is only mildly configurable. The basic idea is that there's a decent way
 to run things and if you do, you should reap the rewards, because then it's
 simple and repeatable. If you want to do things differently, cool! But you've
 already got the power of Python at your fingertips, so you don't really need
 PBR.
 .
 PBR builds on top of the work that d2to1 started to provide for declarative
 configuration. d2to1 is itself an implementation of the ideas behind
 distutils2. Although distutils2 is now abandoned in favor of work towards PEP
 426 and Metadata 2.0, declarative config is still a great idea and
 specifically important in trying to distribute setup code as a library when
 that library itself will alter how the setup is processed. As Metadata 2.0 and
 other modern Python packaging PEPs come out, PBR aims to support them as
 quickly as possible.
 .
 This package provides support for Python 3.x.

Description-en: Python 3 module for PostgreSQL
 psycopg is a PostgreSQL database adapter for the Python3 programming language
 (just like pygresql and popy.) This is version 2, a complete rewrite of the
 original code to provide new-style classes for connection and cursor objects
 and other sweet candies. Like the original, psycopg 2 was written with the
 aim of being very small and fast, and stable as a rock.
 .

 for heavily multi-threaded applications that create and destroy lots of
 cursors and make a conspicuous number of concurrent INSERTs or UPDATEs.
 psycopg 2 also provides full asynchronous operations for the really brave
 programmer.

 end user) between a SAML authority, that is, an identity provider, and a SAML
 consumer, that is, a service provider. SAML 2.0 enables web-based
 authentication and authorization scenarios including cross-domain single
 sign-on (SSO), which helps reduce the administrative overhead of distributing
 multiple authentication tokens to the user.

 Rich is a Python library for rich text and beautiful formatting in the
 terminal.
 .
 The Rich API makes it easy to add color and style to terminal output. Rich can
 also render pretty tables, progress bars, markdown, syntax highlighted source
 code, tracebacks, and more — out of the box.
 .
 Here's a list of the core functionalities of rich:
 .
  * to effortlessly add rich output to your application, you can import the rich
    print method, which has the same signature as the builtin Python function
  * Rich can be installed in the Python REPL, so that any data structures will
    be pretty printed and highlighted
  * for more control over rich terminal content, import and construct a Console
    object. The Console object has a print method which has an intentionally
    similar interface to the builtin print function
  * to insert an emoji in to console output place the name between two colons
  * Rich can render flexible tables with unicode box characters. There is a
    large variety of formatting options for borders, styles, cell alignment etc
  * Rich can render multiple flicker-free progress bars to track long-running
    tasks.
  * Rich can render content in neat columns with equal or optimal width.
  * Rich can render markdown and does a reasonable job of translating the
    formatting to the terminal
  * Rich can render beautiful tracebacks which are easier to read and show more
    code than standard Python tracebacks. You can set Rich as the default
    traceback handler so all uncaught exceptions will be rendered by Rich.

Package: python3-rjsmin
Description-md5: 95d5c84b8b0c2e3703cd6e6462cfb6ab
Description-en: javascript minifier written in Python - Python 3.x
 rJSmin is a javascript minifier written in Python. The minifier is based on
 the semantics of jsmin.c by Douglas Crockford.
 .
 The module is a re-implementation aiming for speed, so it can be used at
 runtime (rather than during a preprocessing step). Usually it produces the
 same results as the original jsmin.c. It differs in the following ways:
 .
  - there is no error detection: unterminated string, regex and comment
    literals are treated as regular javascript code and minified as such.
  - Control characters inside string and regex literals are left untouched; they
    are not converted to spaces (nor to CR)
  - Newline characters are not allowed inside string and regex literals, except
    for line continuations in string literals (ECMA-5).
  - "return /regex/" is recognized correctly.
  - Line terminators after regex literals are handled more sensibly
  - "+ +" and "- -" sequences are not collapsed to '++' or '--'
  - Newlines before ! operators are removed more sensibly
  - Comments starting with an exclamation mark (!) can be kept optionally
  - rJSmin does not handle streams, but only complete strings. (However, the
    module provides a "streamy" interface).
 .
 Since most parts of the logic are handled by the regex engine it's way faster
 than the original Python port of jsmin.c by Baruch Even. The speed factor
 varies between about 6 and 55 depending on input and Python version (it gets
 faster the more compressed the input already is).  Compared to the
 speed-refactored Python port by Dave St.Germain the performance gain is less
 dramatic but still between 3 and 50 (for huge inputs)). See the
 docs/BENCHMARKS file for details.

Package: python3-sqlalchemy
Description-md5: ab3e4e16d880158a692652f7aeb4779d
Description-en: SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper for Python 3
 SQLAlchemy is an SQL database abstraction library for Python.
 Its strengths are:
  * full power and flexibility of SQL. SQLAlchemy provides a full suite
    of well known enterprise-level persistence patterns, designed for
    efficient and high-performing database access, adapted into a simple
    and Pythonic domain language.
  * extremely easy to use for all the basic tasks, such as: accessing pooled
    connections, constructing SQL from Python expressions, finding object
    instances, and committing object modifications back to the database.
  * powerful enough for complicated tasks, such as: eager load a graph of
    objects and their dependencies via joins; map recursive adjacency
    structures automatically; map objects to not just tables but to any
    arbitrary join or select statement; combine multiple tables together to
    load whole sets of otherwise unrelated objects from a single result set;
    commit entire graphs of object changes in one step.
  * built to conform to what DBAs demand, including the ability to swap out
    generated SQL with hand-optimized statements, full usage of bind parameters
    for all literal values, fully transactionalized and consistent updates
    using Unit of Work.
  * modular. Different parts of SQLAlchemy can be used independently of the
    rest, including the connection pool, SQL construction, and ORM. SQLAlchemy
    is constructed in an open style that allows plenty of customization, with
    an architecture that supports custom datatypes, custom SQL extensions, and
    ORM plugins which can augment or extend mapping functionality.

Package: python3-swift
Description-md5: 72c8e0f7c41fa180184a3c3196e4facc
Description-en: distributed virtual object store - Python 3 libraries
 OpenStack Object Storage (code-named Swift) is open source software for
 creating redundant, scalable object storage using clusters of standardized
 servers to store petabytes of accessible data. It is not a file system or
 real-time data storage system, but rather a long-term storage system for a
 more permanent type of static data that can be retrieved, leveraged, and then
 updated if necessary. Primary examples of data that best fit this type of
 storage model are virtual machine images, photo storage, email storage and
 backup archiving. Having no central "brain" or master point of control
 provides greater scalability, redundancy and permanence.
 .
 Objects are written to multiple hardware devices in the data center, with
 the OpenStack software responsible for ensuring data replication and
 integrity across the cluster. Storage clusters can scale horizontally by
 adding new nodes. Should a node fail, OpenStack works to replicate its
 content from other active nodes. Because OpenStack uses software logic to
 ensure data replication and distribution across different devices,
 inexpensive commodity hard drives and servers can be used in lieu of more
 expensive equipment.
 .
 This package provides the Python 3 libraries that actually implement
 everything.

Package: python3-websockify
Description-md5: 231b43a053eb05d5fcdb5e07d0dff5ec
Description-en: WebSockets support for any application/server - Python 3
 websockify was formerly named wsproxy and was part of the noVNC project.
 .
 At the most basic level, websockify just translates WebSockets traffic to
 normal socket traffic. Websockify accepts the WebSockets handshake, parses it,
 and then begins forwarding traffic between the client and the target in both
 directions.
 .
 Websockify supports all versions of the WebSockets protocol (Hixie and HyBi).
 The older Hixie versions of the protocol only support UTF-8 text payloads. In
 order to transport binary data over UTF-8 an encoding must used to encapsulate
 the data within UTF-8.
 .
 With Hixie clients, Websockify uses base64 to encode all traffic to and from
 the client. This does not affect the data between websockify and the server.
 .
 With HyBi clients, websockify negotiates whether to base64 encode traffic to
 and from the client via the subprotocol header (Sec-WebSocket-Protocol). The
 valid subprotocol values are 'binary' and 'base64' and if the client sends
 both then the server (the Python implementation) will prefer 'binary'. The
 'binary' subprotocol indicates that the data will be sent raw using binary
 WebSocket frames. Some HyBi clients (such as the Flash fallback and older
 Chrome and iOS versions) do not support binary data which is why the
 negotiation is necessary.
 .

Package: python3-wrapt
Description-md5: 1a3eaaec5ca5f27019b2bb71093169c4
Description-en: decorators, wrappers and monkey patching. - Python 3.x
 The aim of the wrapt module is to provide a transparent object proxy for
 Python, which can be used as the basis for the construction of function
 wrappers and decorator functions.
 .
 The wrapt module focuses very much on correctness. It therefore goes way
 beyond existing mechanisms such as functools.wraps() to ensure that decorators
 preserve introspectability, signatures, type checking abilities etc. The
 decorators that can be constructed using this module will work in far more
 scenarios than typical decorators and provide more predictable and consistent
 behaviour.
 .
 To ensure that the overhead is as minimal as possible, a C extension module is
 used for performance critical components. An automatic fallback to a pure
 Python implementation is also provided where a target system does not have a
 compiler to allow the C extension to be compiled.
 .
 This package contains the Python 3.x module.

 increased convenience. Enumerations and bit flags become strings and lists
 of strings in Python. Errors are reported as exceptions rather than integer
 errno-style error codes.  The wrapper takes care to provide one-to-many
 mapping of the error codes to the exceptions by interpreting a context
 in which the error code is produced.

Description-en: Router Advertisement Daemon
 IPv6 has a lot more support for autoconfiguration than IPv4. But
 for this autoconfiguration to work on the hosts of a network, the
 routers of the local network have to run a program which answers
 the autoconfiguration requests of the hosts.
 .
 On Linux this program is called radvd, which stands for Router
 ADVertisement Daemon. This daemon listens to router solicitations (RS)
 and answers with router advertisement (RA). Furthermore unsolicited
 RAs are also sent from time to time.

Description-md5: 13b953bd84607c7631a72c5bf042fc1f
Description-en: ruby make-like utility
 Rake is a simple ruby build program with capabilities similar to make.
 .
 Rake has the following features:
   * Rakefiles (rakes version of Makefiles) are completely defined in
     standard Ruby syntax. No XML files to edit. No quirky Makefile
     syntax to worry about (is that a tab or a space?)
   * Users can specify tasks with prerequisites.
   * Rake supports rule patterns to sythesize implicit tasks.
   * Rake is lightweight. It can be distributed with other
     projects as a single file. Projects that depend upon
     rake do not require that rake be installed on target
     systems.

Package: re2c
Description-md5: 21acf839994c0226f94309c2fc0ac4fc
Description-en: lexer generator for C, C++, Go and Rust
 re2c's main goal is generating fast lexers: at least as fast as
 their reasonably optimized hand-coded counterparts. Instead of using
 a traditional table-driven approach, re2c encodes the generated
 finite state automata directly in the form of conditional jumps and
 comparisons. The resulting programs are faster and often smaller
 than their table-driven analogues, and they are much easier to debug
 and understand. Quite a few optimizations are applied in order to
 speed up and compress the generated code.
 .
 Another distinctive feature is its flexible interface: instead of
 assuming a fixed program template, re2c lets the programmer write
 most of the interface code and adapt the generated lexer to any
 particular environment.

Description-en: Ruby library providing a selector API for monitoring IO objects
 nio4r (New IO for Ruby) provides an abstract, cross-platform stateful
 I/O selector API for Ruby. I/O selectors are the heart of
 "reactor"-based event loops, and monitor multiple I/O objects for
 various types of readiness, e.g. ready for reading or writing.
 .
 The most similar API provided by Ruby today is Kernel.select, however
 the select API requires you to pass in arrays of all of the I/O
 objects you're interested in every time. nio4r provides a more
 object-oriented API that lets you register I/O objects with a selector
 then handle them when they're selected for various types of events.
 .
 nio4r is modeled after the Java NIO API, but simplified for
 ease-of-use.
 .
 Its goals are:
 .
  * Expose high-level interfaces for stateful IO selectors.
  * Keep the API small to maximize both portability and performance across
    many different OSes and Ruby VMs.
  * Provide inherently thread-safe facilities for working with IO objects.

Package: sbuild
Description-md5: 9e15ceda32607c62e78e4f4d946f038e
Description-en: Tool for building Debian binary packages from Debian sources
 The sbuild suite of programs (buildd and sbuild) are used to build
 binary packages from source packages.  sbuild does the actual package
 building.
 .
 sbuild uses chroots to build packages, which act as virtual, minimal
 operating system installations dedicated to package building.  This
 means that a number of environments may be used for building
 simultaneously on the same machines, for example stable, testing,
 unstable and experimental.  When coupled with schroot to create
 snapshots of chroots, sbuild may be used to build many packages in
 parallel.  A chroot environment allows packages to be built in a
 controlled, clean environment.  sbuild installs only essential and
 build-essential packages, plus those in the package build
 dependencies.

Package: schroot
Description-md5: 05ddeddba4df3515093084851a978b95
Description-en: Execute commands in a chroot environment
 schroot allows users to execute commands or interactive shells in
 different chroots.  Any number of named chroots may be created, and
 access permissions given to each, including root access for normal
 users, on a per-user or per-group basis.  Additionally, schroot can
 switch to a different user in the chroot, using PAM for
 authentication and authorisation.  All operations are logged for
 security.
 .
 Several different types of chroot are supported, including normal
 directories in the filesystem, and also block devices.  Sessions,
 persistent chroots created on the fly from files (tar with optional
 compression) and Btrfs, ZFS, and LVM snapshots are also supported.
 .
 schroot supports kernel personalities, allowing the programs run
 inside the chroot to have a different personality.  For example,
 running 32-bit chroots on 64-bit systems, or even running binaries
 from alternative operating systems such as SVR4 or Xenix.
 .
 schroot also integrates with sbuild, to allow building packages with
 all supported chroot types, including session-managed chroot types
 such as Btrfs, ZFS, and LVM snapshots.
 .
 schroot shares most of its options with dchroot, but offers vastly
 more functionality.

Description-en: distributed virtual object store - common files
 OpenStack Object Storage (code-named Swift) is open source software for
 creating redundant, scalable object storage using clusters of standardized
 servers to store petabytes of accessible data. It is not a file system or
 real-time data storage system, but rather a long-term storage system for a
 more permanent type of static data that can be retrieved, leveraged, and then
 updated if necessary. Primary examples of data that best fit this type of
 storage model are virtual machine images, photo storage, email storage and
 backup archiving. Having no central "brain" or master point of control
 provides greater scalability, redundancy and permanence.
 .
 Objects are written to multiple hardware devices in the data center, with
 the OpenStack software responsible for ensuring data replication and
 integrity across the cluster. Storage clusters can scale horizontally by
 adding new nodes. Should a node fail, OpenStack works to replicate its
 content from other active nodes. Because OpenStack uses software logic to
 ensure data replication and distribution across different devices,
 inexpensive commodity hard drives and servers can be used in lieu of more
 expensive equipment.

 storage model are virtual machine images, photo storage, email storage and
 backup archiving. Having no central "brain" or master point of control
 provides greater scalability, redundancy and permanence.
 .
 Objects are written to multiple hardware devices in the data center, with
 the OpenStack software responsible for ensuring data replication and
 integrity across the cluster. Storage clusters can scale horizontally by
 adding new nodes. Should a node fail, OpenStack works to replicate its
 content from other active nodes. Because OpenStack uses software logic to
 ensure data replication and distribution across different devices,
 inexpensive commodity hard drives and servers can be used in lieu of more
 expensive equipment.

 file (ATM/Laserwriter), or create a Macintosh Type 1 font file from a
 PFA or PFB font.
 .
 There are currently six programs:
 .
  t1ascii   Converts PFB files to PFA format.
 .
  t1binary  Converts PFA files to PFB format.
 .
  t1disasm  Disassembles a Type 1 font (PFA or PFB format) into a raw,
            human-readable text form for subsequent hand editing,
            tweaking, hint fixing, etcetera...

            stored in MacBinary, AppleSingle, AppleDouble, or BinHex
            format, or as a raw resource fork.  Note that t1unmac does
            not have to run on a Macintosh, but makes Macintosh Type 1
            fonts available for use on Unix machines and PCs.
 .
  t1mac     Creates a Macintosh Type 1 file from a PFA- or PFB-format

            AppleSingle, AppleDouble, or BinHex format, or as a raw
            resource fork.  WARNING: This tool will not suffice to
            allow you to use the new font on a Macintosh, as
            Macintoshes cannot read raw Type 1 fonts.  You will need
            to create a font suitcase containing bitmap fonts.  If you
            do not already have such a suitcase for the font, T1utils
            will not help you create one.

Description-md5: 83e3ff2859524c831253d938da348878
Description-en: Update Configuration File(s): preserve user changes to config files
 Debian policy mandates that user changes to configuration files must be
 preserved during package upgrades. The easy way to achieve this behavior
 is to make the configuration file a 'conffile', in which case dpkg
 handles the file specially during upgrades, prompting the user as
 needed.
 .
 This is appropriate only if it is possible to distribute a default
 version that will work for most installations, although some system
 administrators may choose to modify it. This implies that the
 default version will be part of the package distribution, and must
 not be modified by the maintainer scripts during installation (or at
 any other time).
 .
 This script attempts to provide conffile-like handling for files that
 may not be labelled conffiles, and are not shipped in a Debian package,
 but handled by the postinst instead. This script allows one to
 maintain files in /etc, preserving user changes and in general
 offering the same facilities while upgrading that dpkg normally
 provides for 'conffiles'.
 .
 Additionally, this script provides facilities for transitioning a
 file that had not been provided with conffile-like protection to come
 under this schema, and attempts to minimize questions asked at
 installation time. Indeed, the transitioning facility is better than the
 one offered by dpkg while transitioning a file from a non-conffile to
 conffile status.

 Wget is a network utility to retrieve files from the web
 using HTTP(S) and FTP, the two most widely used internet
 protocols. It works non-interactively, so it will work in
 the background, after having logged off. The program supports
 recursive retrieval of web-authoring pages as well as FTP
 sites -- you can use Wget to make mirrors of archives and
 home pages or to travel the web like a WWW robot.
 .
 Wget works particularly well with slow or unstable connections
 by continuing to retrieve a document until the document is fully
 downloaded. Re-getting files from where it left off works on
 servers (both HTTP and FTP) that support it. Both HTTP and FTP
 retrievals can be time stamped, so Wget can see if the remote
 file has changed since the last retrieval and automatically
 retrieve the new version if it has.
 .
 Wget supports proxy servers; this can lighten the network load,
 speed up retrieval, and provide access behind firewalls.

 originally part of the Flatpak project, but it has been broken out as
 a standalone module to facilitate using it in other contexts, for
 example in WebKit-GTK's optional bubblewrap-based sandbox.
 .
 For this proxy to be useful, restricted D-Bus clients must be denied
 access to the normal D-Bus socket (for example by using containers or
 AppArmor rules), and instead given access to the listening Unix socket
 created by the proxy (typically by bind-mounting it into a Linux
 container).

Package: xdg-desktop-portal
Description-md5: 7eac259f6a9a24c9e234ad737a8c6945
Description-en: desktop integration portal for Flatpak and Snap
 xdg-desktop-portal provides a portal frontend service for Flatpak, Snap,
 and possibly other desktop containment/sandboxing frameworks. This service
 is made available to the sandboxed application, and provides mediated
 D-Bus interfaces for file access, URI opening, printing and similar
 desktop integration features.
 .
 The implementation of these interfaces is expected to require
 user confirmation before responding to the sandboxed application's
 requests. For example, when the sandboxed application ask to open a file,
 the portal implementation will open an "Open" dialog outside the sandbox,
 and will only make the selected file available to the sandboxed app if
 that dialog is confirmed.
 .
 xdg-desktop-portal is designed to be desktop-agnostic, and uses a
 desktop-environment-specific GUI backend such as xdg-desktop-portal-gtk
 to provide its functionality.

Package: xdg-user-dirs
Description-md5: bede57a95f8202be418742bfd703ba9d
Description-en: tool to manage well known user directories
 xdg-user-dirs is a tool to help manage "well known" user directories
 like the desktop folder and the music folder. It also handles
 localization (i.e. translation) of the filenames.
 .
 The way it works is that xdg-user-dirs-update is run very early in the
 login phase. This program reads a configuration file, and a set of
 default directories. It then creates localized versions of these
 directories in the users home directory and sets up a config file in
 $(XDG_CONFIG_HOME)/user-dirs.dirs (XDG_CONFIG_HOME defaults to
 ~/.config) that applications can read to find these directories.

Package: xfonts-base
Description-md5: b523687dc2655def36c6861a16a103b0
Description-en: standard fonts for X
 xfonts-base provides a standard set of low-resolution bitmapped fonts.  In
 most cases it is desirable to have the X font server (xfs) and/or an X server
 installed to make the fonts available to X clients.

Package: xfonts-encodings
Description-md5: 756f2a9079a3a81226ce262c1c944fd7
Description-en: Encodings for X.Org fonts
 This package contains the encodings that map to specific characters.

Package: xfonts-scalable
Description-md5: 130f2543a116db5cfb1067f413a7dc80
Description-en: scalable fonts for X
 xfonts-scalable provides fonts that can be drawn at any size by the X server
 or font server without loss of quality.  In most cases it is desirable to
 have the X font server (xfs) and/or an X server installed to make the fonts
 available to X clients.
 .
 This package is missing three fonts from the X.Org source archives
 because the license terms on the fonts do not meet the Debian Free
 Software Guidelines; they are the Type1 fonts Adobe Utopia, IBM Courier,
 and Bigelow & Holmes (B&H) Luxi.
 .
 This package requires the xutils package to prepare the font directories
 for use by an X server or X font server.

Package: xfonts-utils
Description-md5: cfb627fb99a0d0ef5d7b0b2f94423328
Description-en: X Window System font utility programs
 xfonts-utils provides a set of utility programs shipped with the X Window
 System that are needed for font management.
 .
 The programs in this package include:
  - bdftopcf, which converts BDF fonts to PCF fonts;
  - bdftruncate and ucs2any, tools to generate fonts with various encodings
    from ISO 10646-encoded fonts
  - mkfontdir, a program to generate fonts.dir files;
  - mkfontscale, a program to generate fonts.scale files;
  - fonttosfnt, a program to wrap bitmap fonts in a sfnt (TrueType) wrapper.

Package: xfsdump
Description-md5: 8448ced317c37d3587808bf000f24a98
Description-en: Administrative utilities for the XFS filesystem
 The xfsdump package contains xfsdump, xfsrestore and a number of
 other administrative utilities for managing XFS filesystems.
 .
 xfsdump examines files in a filesystem, determines which need to be
 backed up, and copies those files to a specified disk, tape or other
 storage medium.  It uses XFS-specific directives for optimizing the
 dump of an XFS filesystem, and also knows how to backup XFS extended
 attributes.  Backups created with xfsdump are "endian safe" and can
 thus be transfered between Linux machines of different architectures
 and also between IRIX machines.
 .
 xfsrestore performs the inverse function of xfsdump; it can restore a
 full backup of a filesystem.  Subsequent incremental backups can then
 be layered on top of the full backup.  Single files and directory
 subtrees may be restored from full or partial backups.

    the first partition reports the size of the ISO image, but starts at a
    non-zero address. It is nevertheless still mountable.
  - Jigdo Template Export - jigdo representation of the resulting ISO-9660
    image, generated on the fly.

Package: zerofree
Description-md5: e8c47b284082ddf9145a003c9cbeafdb
Description-en: zero free blocks from ext2, ext3 and ext4 file-systems
 Zerofree finds the unallocated blocks with non-zero value content in
 an ext2, ext3 or ext4 file-system and fills them with zeroes
 (zerofree can also work with another value than zero). This is mostly
 useful if the device on which this file-system resides is a disk
 image. In this case, depending on the type of disk image, a secondary
 utility may be able to reduce the size of the disk image after
 zerofree has been run. Zerofree requires the file-system to be
 unmounted or mounted read-only.
 .
 The usual way to achieve the same result (zeroing the unused
 blocks) is to run "dd" to create a file full of zeroes that takes up
 the entire free space on the drive, and then delete this file. This
 has many disadvantages, which zerofree alleviates:
  * it is slow;
  * it makes the disk image (temporarily) grow to its maximal extent;
  * it (temporarily) uses all free space on the disk, so other
    concurrent write actions may fail.
 .
 Zerofree has been written to be run from GNU/Linux systems installed
 as guest OSes inside a virtual machine. If this is not your case, you
 almost certainly don't need this package. (One other use case would
 be to erase sensitive data a little bit more securely than with a
 simple "rm").
