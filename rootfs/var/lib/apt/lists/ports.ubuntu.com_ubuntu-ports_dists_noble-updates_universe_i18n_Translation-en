Package: 2to3
Description-md5: f572313f6474fd18ce500cec46aba367
Description-en: 2to3 binary using python3
 2to3 is a Python program that reads Python 2.x source code and applies a
 series of fixers to transform it into valid Python 3.x code. The standard
 library contains a rich set of fixers that will handle almost all code. 2to3
 supporting library lib2to3 is, however, a flexible and generic library, so it
 is possible to write your own fixers for 2to3. lib2to3 could also be adapted
 to custom applications in which Python code needs to be edited automatically.
 .
 This package is a dependency package, which depends on Debian's default
 Python 3 2to3 version (currently v3.12).

 acmetool is an easy-to-use command line tool for automatically
 acquiring TLS certificates from ACME (Automated Certificate Management
 Environment) servers such as Let's Encrypt, designed to flexibly
 integrate into your webserver setup to enable automatic verification.
 .
 acmetool is designed to work like make: you specify what certificates
 you want, and acmetool obtains certificates as necessary to satisfy
 those requirements. If the requirements are already satisfied,
 acmetool doesn't do anything when invoked. Thus, acmetool is
 ideally suited for use on a cron job; it will do nothing until
 certificates are near expiry, and then obtain new ones.
 .
 acmetool is designed to minimise the use of state and be transparent
 in the state that it does use. All state, including certificates, is
 stored in a single directory, by default /var/lib/acme. The schema
 for this directory is simple, comprehensible and documented.

 Blueprint is a meta-build system that reads in Blueprints files that
 describe modules that need to be built, and produces a Ninja manifest
 describing the commands that need to be run and their dependencies.
 Where most build systems use built-in rules or a domain-specific language
 to describe the logic for converting module descriptions to build rules,
 Blueprint delegates this to per-project build logic written in Go.
 For large, heterogenous projects this allows the inherent complexity
 of the build logic to be maintained in a high-level language, while
 still allowing simple changes to individual modules by modifying easy
 to understand Blueprints files.

Description-en: boot off a rescue volume rather than root filesystem
 This package adds functionality to an initramfs built by initramfs-tools.
 When installed the initramfs will check to see if any partitions
 with a label of 'RESCUE_VOL' are attached.  If such a volume is attached,
 it will boot off that volume rather than the root volume.
 .

Package: crowdsec
Description-md5: 7b42942378aab9e4affe682dd9fa1b39
Description-en: lightweight and collaborative security engine
 CrowdSec is a lightweight security engine, able to detect and remedy
 aggressive network behavior. It can leverage and also enrich a
 global community-wide IP reputation database, to help fight online
 cybersec aggressions in a collaborative manner.
 .
 CrowdSec can read many log sources, parse and also enrich them, in
 order to detect specific scenarios, that usually represent malevolent
 behavior. Parsers, Enrichers, and Scenarios are YAML files that can
 be shared and downloaded through a specific Hub, as well as be created
 or adapted locally.
 .
 Detection results are available for CrowdSec, its CLI tools and
 bouncers via an HTTP API. Triggered scenarios lead to an alert, which
 often results in a decision (e.g. IP banned for 4 hours) that can be
 consumed by bouncers (software components enforcing a decision, such
 as an iptables ban, an nginx lua script, or any custom user script).
 .
 The CLI allows users to deploy a Metabase Docker image to provide
 simple-to-deploy dashboards of ongoing activity. The CrowdSec daemon
 is also instrumented with Prometheus to provide observability.
 .
 CrowdSec can be used against live logs (“à la fail2ban”), but can
 also work on cold logs to help, in a forensic context, to build an
 analysis for past events.
 .
 On top of that, CrowdSec aims at sharing detection signals amongst
 all participants, to pre-emptively allow users to block likely
 attackers. To achieve this, minimal meta-information about the attack
 is shared with the CrowdSec organization for further retribution.
 .
 Users can also decide not to take part into the collective effort via
 the central API, but to register on a local API instead.

 device availability.  Therefore, instead of scripts hard-coded to do
 various things, we depend on udev to create device nodes for us and
 then when we have the rootfs's device node, we mount and carry on.

 To interact the client certificates, application code should not need to
 use most of these proxies within this repository directly. Instead, the
 application should leverage the clients and toolings provided by Google
 such as Cloud SDK (https://cloud.google.com/sdk) to have a more
 convenient developer experience.

Description-en: ban hosts that cause multiple authentication errors
 Fail2ban monitors log files (e.g. /var/log/auth.log,
 /var/log/apache/access.log) and temporarily or persistently bans
 failure-prone addresses by updating existing firewall rules.  Fail2ban
 allows easy specification of different actions to be taken such as to ban
 an IP using iptables or hostsdeny rules, or simply to send a notification
 email.
 .
 By default, it comes with filter expressions for various services
 (sshd, Apache, proftpd, sasl, etc.) but configuration can be
 easily extended for monitoring any other text file.  All filters and
 actions are given in the config files, thus fail2ban can be adopted
 to be used with a variety of files and firewalls.  Following recommends
 are listed:
 .
  - iptables/nftables -- default installation uses iptables for banning.
    nftables is also supported. You most probably need it
  - whois -- used by a number of *mail-whois* actions to send notification
    emails with whois information about attacker hosts. Unless you will use
    those you don't need whois
  - python3-pyinotify -- unless you monitor services logs via systemd, you
    need pyinotify for efficient monitoring for log files changes

Package: flatpak
Description-md5: f91acb1d2880527b2759bc5e2d99fbff
Description-en: Application deployment framework for desktop apps
 Flatpak installs, manages and runs sandboxed desktop application bundles.
 Application bundles run partially isolated from the wider system, using
 containerization techniques such as namespaces to prevent direct access
 to system resources. Resources from outside the sandbox can be accessed
 via "portal" services, which are responsible for access control; for
 example, the Documents portal displays an "Open" dialog outside the
 sandbox, then allows the application to access only the selected file.
 .
 Each application uses a specified "runtime", or set of libraries, which is
 available as /usr inside its sandbox. This can be used to run application
 bundles with multiple, potentially incompatible sets of dependencies within
 the same desktop environment.
 .
 This package contains the services and executables needed to install and
 launch sandboxed applications, and the portal services needed to provide
 limited access to resources outside the sandbox.

Package: gogottrpc
Description-md5: 5fb0782f7a7f6b0c43215d1dc436e4f9
Description-en: GRPC for low-memory environments - utilities
 The existing grpc-go project requires a lot of memory overhead for
 importing packages and at runtime. While this is great for many services
 with low density requirements, this can be a problem when running a
 large number of services on a single machine or on a machine with a
 small amount of memory.
 .
 Using the same GRPC definitions, this project reduces the binary size
 and protocol overhead required. We do this by eliding the net/http,
 net/http2 and grpc package used by grpc replacing it with a lightweight
 framing protocol. The result are smaller binaries that use less resident
 memory with the same ease of use as GRPC.
 .
 Please note that while this project supports generating either end of
 the protocol, the generated service definitions will be incompatible

Package: golang-github-bmatsuo-lmdb-go-dev
Description-md5: f41a76e1b1bf0e4f43708627e519ab38
Description-en: Bindings for the LMDB C library
 Go bindings to the OpenLDAP Lightning Memory-Mapped Database (LMDB).
 Packages Functionality is logically divided into several packages.
 Applications will usually need to import lmdb but may import other
 packages on an as needed basis.
 .
 Packages in the exp/ directory are not stable and may change without
 warning.  That said, they are generally usable if application
 dependencies are managed and pinned by tag/commit.
 .
 Developers concerned with package stability should consult the
 documentation.  lmdb GoDoc
 (https://godoc.org/github.com/bmatsuo/lmdb-go/lmdb)
 stable (#user-content-versioning-and-stability)
 go import "github.com/bmatsuo/lmdb-go/lmdb"

 stable (#user-content-versioning-and-stability)
 go import "github.com/bmatsuo/lmdb-go/lmdbscan"
 .
 A utility package for scanning database ranges. The API is inspired by
 bufio.Scanner (https://godoc.org/bufio#Scanner) and the python cursor
 implementation (https://lmdb.readthedocs.org/en/release/#cursor-class).
 exp/lmdbpool GoDoc
 (https://godoc.org/github.com/bmatsuo/lmdb-go/exp/lmdbpool)
 experimental (#user-content-versioning-and-stability)
 go import "github.com/bmatsuo/lmdb-go/exp/lmdbpool"
 .
 A utility package which facilitates reuse of lmdb.Txn objects using a
 sync.Pool. Naively storing lmdb.Txn objects in sync.Pool can be
 troublesome. And the lmdbpool.TxnPool type has been defined as a
 complete pooling solution and as reference for applications attempting
 to write their own pooling implementation.
 .
 The lmdbpool package is relatively new. But it has a lot of potential
 utility.  And once the lmdbpool API has been ironed out, and the
 implementation hardened through use by real applications it can be
 integrated directly into the lmdb package for more transparent
 integration.  Please test this package and provide feedback to speed
 this process up.  exp/lmdbsync GoDoc
 (https://godoc.org/github.com/bmatsuo/lmdb-go/exp/lmdbsync)
 experimental (#user-content-versioning-and-stability)
 go import "github.com/bmatsuo/lmdb-go/exp/lmdbsync"
 .
 An experimental utility package that provides synchronization necessary
 to change an environment's map size after initialization. The package
 provides error handlers to automatically manage database size and retry
 failed transactions.
 .
 The lmdbsync package is usable but the implementation of Handlers are
 unstable and may change in incompatible ways without notice.
 The use cases of dynamic map sizes and multiprocessing are niche and
 the package requires much more development driven by practical feedback
 before the Handler API and the provided implementations can be
 considered stable.  Key Features: Idiomatic API inspired by BoltDB
 (https://github.com/boltdb/bolt) with automatic commit/rollback of
 transactions. The goal of lmdb-go is to provide idiomatic database
 interactions without compromising the flexibility of the C API.
 .
 NOTE: While the lmdb package tries hard to make LMDB as easy to
 use as possible there are compromises, gotchas, and caveats that
 application developers must be aware of when relying on LMDB to store
 their data.  All users are encouraged to fully read the documentation
 (https://godoc.org/github.com/bmatsuo/lmdb-go/lmdb) so they are aware
 of these caveats.
 .
 Where the lmdb package and its implementation decisions do not
 meet the needs of application developers in terms of safety or
 operational use the lmdbsync package has been designed to wrap lmdb and
 safely fill in additional functionality.  Consult the documentation
 (https://godoc.org/github.com/bmatsuo/lmdb-go/exp/lmdbsync) for more
 information about the lmdbsync package.  API coverage The lmdb-go
 project aims for complete coverage of the LMDB C API (within reason).
 Some notable features and optimizations that are supported: • Idiomatic
 subtransactions ("sub-updates") that allow the batching of updates.•
 Batch IO on databases utilizing the MDB_DUPSORT and MDB_DUPFIXED flags.•
 Reserved writes than can save in memory copies converting/buffering into
 []byte.  For tracking purposes a list of unsupported features is kept in
 an issue (https://github.com/bmatsuo/lmdb-go/issues/1).  Zero-copy reads
 Applications with high performance requirements can opt-in to fast,
 zero-copy reads at the cost of runtime safety.  Zero-copy behavior is
 specified at the transaction level to reduce instrumentation overhead.
 .
 ``` err := lmdb.View(func(txn *lmdb.Txn) error {
     // RawRead enables zero-copy behavior with some serious caveats.
     // Read the documentation carefully before using.  txn.RawRead = true
 val, err := txn.Get(dbi, []byte("largevalue"), 0) // ...
 .
 }) ``` Documentation Comprehensive documentation and examples
 are provided to demonstrate safe usage of lmdb.  In addition to
 godoc (https://godoc.org/github.com/bmatsuo/lmdb-go) documentation,
 implementations of the standand LMDB commands (mdb_stat, etc) can be found
 in the cmd/ (cmd/) directory and some simple experimental commands can be
 found in the exp/cmd/ (exp/cmd) directory.  Aside from providing minor
 utility these programs are provided as examples of lmdb in practice.
 LMDB compared to BoltDB: BoltDB is a quality database with a design
 similar to LMDB.  Both store key-value data in a file and provide ACID
 transactions.  So there are often questions of why to use one database
 or the other.  Advantages of BoltDB• Nested databases allow for
 hierarchical data organization.• Far more databases can be accessed
 concurrently.• Operating systems that do not support sparse files do
 not use up excessive space due to a large pre-allocation of file space.
 The exp/lmdbsync package is intended to resolve this problem with
 LMDB but it is not ready.• As a pure Go package bolt can be easily
 cross-compiled using the go toolchain and GOOS/GOARCH variables.• Its
 simpler design and implementation in pure Go mean it is free of many
 caveats and gotchas which are present using the lmdb package.  For more
 information about caveats with the lmdb package, consult its documentation
 (https://godoc.org/github.com/bmatsuo/lmdb-go/lmdb).Advantages of LMDB•
 Keys can contain multiple values using the DupSort flag.• Updates can
 have sub-updates for atomic batching of changes.• Databases typically
 remain open for the application lifetime.  This limits the number of
 concurrently accessible databases.  But, this minimizes the overhead of
 database accesses and typically produces cleaner code than an equivalent
 BoltDB implementation.• Significantly faster than BoltDB.  The raw
 speed of LMDB easily surpasses BoltDB.  Additionally, LMDB provides
 optimizations ranging from safe, feature-specific optimizations to
 generally unsafe, extremely situational ones.  Applications are free to
 enable any optimizations that fit their data, access, and reliability
 models.• LMDB allows multiple applications to access a database
 simultaneously.  Updates from concurrent processes are synchronized using
 a database lock file.• As a C library, applications in any language
 can interact with LMDB databases.  Mission critical Go applications can
 use a database while Python scripts perform analysis on the side.Build
 There is no dependency on shared libraries.  So most users can simply
 install using go get.

 to enable the optimisation.  DocumentationGo doc The go doc documentation
 available on godoc.org (https://godoc.org/github.com/bmatsuo/lmdb-go)
 is the primary source of developer documentation for lmdb-go.
 It provides an overview of the API with a lot of usage examples.
 Where necessary the documentation points out differences between
 the semantics of methods and their C counterparts.  LMDB The
 LMDB homepage (http://symas.com/mdb/) and mailing list (archives
 (http://www.openldap.org/lists/openldap-technical/)) are the official
 source of documentation regarding low-level LMDB operation and internals.
 .
 Along with an API reference LMDB provides a high-level summary
 (http://symas.com/mdb/doc/starting.html) of the library.  While lmdb-go
 abstracts many of the thread and transaction details by default the rest
 of the guide is still useful to compare with go doc.  Versioning and
 Stability The lmdb-go project makes regular releases with IDs X.Y.Z.
 All packages outside of the exp/ directory are considered stable and
 adhere to the guidelines of semantic versioning (http://semver.org/).
 .
 Experimental packages (those packages in exp/) are not required to adhere
 to semantic versioning.  However packages specifically declared to merely
 be "unstable" can be relied on more for long term use with less concern.
 .
 The API of an unstable package may change in subtle ways between minor
 release versions.  But deprecations will be indicated at least one
 release in advance and all functionality will remain available through
 some method.  License Except where otherwise noted files in the lmdb-go

Package: golang-github-brentp-gsort-dev
Description-md5: c6f4c72d1c5a09aa0478cb823e35f294
Description-en: library package for gsort
 Package gsort is a library for sorting a stream of tab-delimited lines
 ([]bytes) (from a reader) using the amount of memory requested.
 .
 Instead of using a compare function as most sorts do, this accepts a
 user-defined function with signature: func(line []byte) []int where the
 []ints are used to determine ordering. For example if sorting
 on 2 columns, one of months and another of day of months, the function
 would replace "Jan" with 1 and "Feb" with 2 for the first column and
 just return the Atoi of the 2nd column.

Package: golang-github-containerd-ttrpc-dev
Description-md5: 21323f9c4b8163ddbaa6c2f1db8826cc
Description-en: GRPC for low-memory environments
 The existing grpc-go project requires a lot of memory overhead for
 importing packages and at runtime. While this is great for many services
 with low density requirements, this can be a problem when running a
 large number of services on a single machine or on a machine with a
 small amount of memory.
 .
 Using the same GRPC definitions, this project reduces the binary size
 and protocol overhead required. We do this by eliding the net/http,
 net/http2 and grpc package used by grpc replacing it with a lightweight
 framing protocol. The result are smaller binaries that use less resident
 memory with the same ease of use as GRPC.
 .
 Please note that while this project supports generating either end of
 the protocol, the generated service definitions will be incompatible
 with regular GRPC services, as they do not speak the same protocol.

 Notary is a project that allows anyone to have trust over arbitrary
 collections of data.
 .
 The Notary project comprises a server (cmd/notary-server) and a client
 (cmd/notary) for running and interacting with trusted collections.
 .
 Notary aims to make the internet more secure by making it easy for people to
 publish and verify content. We often rely on TLS to secure our communications
 with a web server which is inherently flawed, as any compromise of the server
 enables malicious content to be substituted for the legitimate content.
 .
 With Notary, publishers can sign their content offline using keys kept highly
 secure. Once the publisher is ready to make the content available, they can
 push their signed trusted collection to a Notary Server.
 .
 Consumers, having acquired the publisher's public key through a secure
 channel, can then communicate with any notary server or (insecure) mirror,
 relying only on the publisher's key to determine the validity and integrity
 of the received content.

Package: golang-github-go-enry-go-license-detector-dev
Description-md5: e3768a14a261164294314df9bb71bf99
Description-en: Reliable project licenses detector (library)
 It scans the given directory for license files, normalizes and hashes them
 and outputs all the fuzzy matches with the list of reference texts.  The
 returned names follow SPDX standard.

 Why? There are no similar projects which can be compiled into a native binary
 without dependencies and also support the whole SPDX license database
 (≈400 items). This implementation is also fast, requires little memory, and
 the API is easy to use.

Package: golang-github-google-blueprint-dev
Description-md5: f029736b810386632d9b7249aea19de0
Description-en: Blueprint meta build system (library)
 Blueprint is a meta-build system that reads in Blueprints files that
 describe modules that need to be built, and produces a Ninja manifest
 describing the commands that need to be run and their dependencies.
 Where most build systems use built-in rules or a domain-specific language
 to describe the logic for converting module descriptions to build rules,
 Blueprint delegates this to per-project build logic written in Go.
 For large, heterogenous projects this allows the inherent complexity
 of the build logic to be maintained in a high-level language, while
 still allowing simple changes to individual modules by modifying easy
 to understand Blueprints files.
 .
 This package contains the Go library for Blueprint.

 your Google Cloud resources, the end user device certificate
 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client_certificate) is one of the
 credentials that is verified before access to a resource is granted. You
 can configure Google Cloud to use the device certificates in your
 operating system key store when verifying access to a resource from the
 gcloud CLI or Terraform by using the enterprise certificates feature.

 Google Enterprise Certificate Proxies (ECP) are part of the Google Cloud
 Zero Trust architecture (/zerotrust) that enables mutual authentication
 with client-side certificates
 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client_certificate). This repository
 contains a set of proxies/modules that can be used by clients or
 toolings to interact with certificates that are stored in protected key
 storage systems (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_management).

 To interact the client certificates, application code should not need to
 use most of these proxies within this repository directly. Instead, the
 application should leverage the clients and toolings provided by Google
 such as Cloud SDK (https://cloud.google.com/sdk) to have a more
 convenient developer experience.

 software updater for embedded Linux devices. Mender comprises a client
 running at the embedded device, as well as a server that manages
 deployments across many devices.
 .
 This repository contains the artifacts library, which is used by the
 Mender client, command line interface, server and for build integration
 with the Yocto Project.
 .
 The artifacts library makes it easy to programmatically work with a
 Mender artifact, which is a file that can be recognized by its .mender
 suffix. Mender artifacts can contain binaries, metadata, checksums,
 signatures and scripts that are used during a deployment. The artifact
 format acts as a wrapper, and uses the tar format to bundle several
 files into one.
 .
 In its simplest form, an artifact contains just a rootfs image, along
 with its checksum, id and device type compatibility.
 .
 The artifacts library might also be useful for other updaters or
 purposes. We are always happy to see other uses of it!
 .
 Mender logo Getting started To start using Mender, we recommend that
 you begin with the Getting started section in the Mender documentation
 (https://docs.mender.io/).  Using the library You can use the parser
 and reader in go in the standard way:
 .
 import (
         "github.com/mendersoftware/mender-artifact/parser"
         "github.com/mendersoftware/mender-artifact/reader"

Description-en: Builds container images using Dockerfile as input
 This library supports using the Dockerfile syntax to build OCI & Docker
 compatible images, without invoking a container build command such
 as buildah bud or docker build. It is intended to give clients more
 control over how they build container images, including:
  - Instead of building one layer per line, run all instructions in the
    same container
  - Set HostConfig settings like network and memory controls that are
    not available when running container builds
  - Mount external files into the build that are not persisted as part
    of the final image (i.e. "secrets")
  - If there are no RUN commands in the Dockerfile, the container is
    created and committed, but never started.  The final image should be
    99.9% compatible with regular container builds, but bugs are always
    possible.
 .
 This package provides sources that other package may require for
 building.

Description-en: K-Sortable Globally Unique IDs (Go library)
 ksuid is an efficient, comprehensive, battle-tested Go library for
 generating and parsing a specific kind of globally unique identifier
 called a *KSUID*. This library serves as its reference implementation.
 .
 What is a KSUID?
 .
 KSUID is for K-Sortable Unique IDentifier. It is a kind of globally
 unique identifier similar to a RFC 4122 UUID, built from the ground-up
 to be "naturally" sorted by generation timestamp without any special
 type-aware logic.
 .
 In short, running a set of KSUIDs through the UNIX sort command will
 result in a list ordered by generation time.
 .
 Why use KSUIDs?
 .
 There are numerous methods for generating unique identifiers, so why
 KSUID?
 .
  1. Naturally ordered by generation time
  2. Collision-free, coordination-free, dependency-free
  3. Highly portable representations
 .

Description-en: tar archive assembly/disassembly (source)
 Pristinely disassembling a tar archive, and stashing needed raw bytes and
 offsets to reassemble a validating original archive.
 .
 Eventually this should detect TARs that this is not possible with.
 .
 For example stored sparse files that have "holes" in them, will be read as a
 contiguous file, though the archive contents may be recorded in sparse format.
 Therefore when adding the file payload to a reassembled tar, to achieve
 identical output, the file payload would need be precisely re-sparsified. This
 is not something I seek to fix immediately, but would rather have an alert that
 precise reassembly is not possible. (see more
 http://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_node/Sparse-Formats.html)
 .
 Other caveat, while tar archives support having multiple file entries for the
 same path, we will not support this feature. If there are more than one entries
 with the same path, expect an err (like ErrDuplicatePath) or a resulting tar
 stream that does not validate your original checksum/signature.
 .
 Contract: Do not break the API of stdlib archive/tar in our fork (ideally find
 an upstream mergeable solution).

Package: gosu
Description-md5: 72c0b42347139534207936c653f27fc4
Description-en: Simple Go-based setuid+setgid+setgroups+exec
 This is a simple tool grown out of the simple fact that "su" and "sudo" have
 very strange and often annoying TTY and signal-forwarding behavior. They're
 also somewhat complex to setup and use (especially in the case of "sudo"),
 which allows for a great deal of expressivity, but falls flat if all you need
 is "run this specific application as this specific user and get out of the
 pipeline".
 .
 The core of how "gosu" works is stolen directly from how Docker/libcontainer
 itself starts an application inside a container (and in fact, is using the
 "/etc/passwd" processing code directly from libcontainer's codebase).
 .
 Once the user/group is processed, we switch to that user, then we "exec" the
 specified process and "gosu" itself is no longer resident or involved in the
 process lifecycle at all. This avoids all the issues of signal passing and TTY,
 and punts them to the process invoking "gosu" and the process being invoked by
 "gosu", where they belong.

 The Heartbleed Bug is a serious vulnerability in the popular OpenSSL
 cryptographic software library. This weakness allows stealing the
 information protected, under normal conditions, by the SSL/TLS
 encryption used to secure the Internet. SSL/TLS provides communication
 security and privacy over the Internet for applications such as web,
 email, instant messaging (IM) and some virtual private networks (VPNs).

 The Heartbleed bug allows anyone on the Internet to read the memory
 of the systems protected by the vulnerable versions of the OpenSSL
 software. This compromises the secret keys used to identify the service
 providers and to encrypt the traffic, the names and passwords of the
 users and the actual content. This allows attackers to eavesdrop on
 communications, steal data directly from the services and users and
 to impersonate services and users.

Package: ksuid
Description-md5: efb053d9087345d1a529fe6ec7af613f
Description-en: K-Sortable Globally Unique IDs (program)
 ksuid is an efficient, comprehensive, battle-tested Go library for
 generating and parsing a specific kind of globally unique identifier
 called a *KSUID*. This library serves as its reference implementation.
 .
 This package comes with a command-line tool ksuid, useful for generating
 KSUIDs as well as inspecting the internal components of existing KSUIDs.
 Machine-friendly output is provided for scripting use cases.
 .
 What is a KSUID?
 .
 KSUID is for K-Sortable Unique IDentifier. It is a kind of globally
 unique identifier similar to a RFC 4122 UUID, built from the ground-up
 to be "naturally" sorted by generation timestamp without any special
 type-aware logic.
 .
 In short, running a set of KSUIDs through the UNIX sort command will
 result in a list ordered by generation time.
 .
 Why use KSUIDs?
 .
 There are numerous methods for generating unique identifiers, so why
 KSUID?
 .
  1. Naturally ordered by generation time
  2. Collision-free, coordination-free, dependency-free
  3. Highly portable representations
 .

Package: libfuzzer-18-dev
Description-md5: bc55cd127b8dab148b78e61e5e475b8e
Description-en: Library for coverage-guided fuzz testing
 LibFuzzer is a library for in-process, coverage-guided, evolutionary fuzzing
 of other libraries.
 .
 LibFuzzer is similar in concept to American Fuzzy Lop (AFL), but it performs
 all of its fuzzing inside a single process. This in-process fuzzing can be
 more restrictive and fragile, but is potentially much faster as there is no
 overhead for process start-up.
 .
 The fuzzer is linked with the library under test, and feeds fuzzed inputs to
 the library via a specific fuzzing entrypoint (aka 'target function'); the
 fuzzer then tracks which areas of the code are reached, and generates mutations
 on the corpus of input data in order to maximize the code coverage. The code
 coverage information for libFuzzer is provided by LLVM's SanitizerCoverage
 instrumentation.

Package: license-detector
Description-md5: 6dbbf3e5d1e2fe29a2325bceadb26b87
Description-en: Reliable project licenses detector (command line)
 It scans the given directory for license files, normalizes and hashes them
 and outputs all the fuzzy matches with the list of reference texts.  The
 returned names follow SPDX standard.
 .
 Why? There are no similar projects which can be compiled into a native binary
 without dependencies and also support the whole SPDX license database
 (≈400 items). This implementation is also fast, requires little memory, and
 the API is easy to use.
 .
 The detection algorithm is not template matching; this directly implies that
 go-license-detector does not provide any legal guarantees. The intended area
 of it's usage is data mining.
 .
 This package provides the command line interface.

Package: llvm-18
Description-md5: 07d463911771b9679a5f0131f40992d4
Description-en: Modular compiler and toolchain technologies
 LLVM is a collection of libraries and tools that make it easy to build
 compilers, optimizers, just-in-time code generators, and many other
 compiler-related programs.
 .
 LLVM uses a single, language-independent virtual instruction set both
 as an offline code representation (to communicate code between
 compiler phases and to run-time systems) and as the compiler internal
 representation (to analyze and transform programs). This persistent
 code representation allows a common set of sophisticated compiler
 techniques to be applied at compile-time, link-time, install-time,
 run-time, or "idle-time" (between program runs).
 .
 The strengths of the LLVM infrastructure are its extremely
 simple design (which makes it easy to understand and use),
 source-language independence, powerful mid-level optimizer, automated
 compiler debugging support, extensibility, and its stability and
 reliability. LLVM is currently being used to host a wide variety of
 academic research projects and commercial projects. LLVM includes C
 and C++ front-ends, a front-end for a Forth-like language (Stacker),
 a young scheme front-end, and Java support is in development. LLVM can
 generate code for X96, SparcV10, PowerPC or many other architectures.

Description-md5: f63cb2510c63afcdfdc6f0f55a578cad
Description-en: Mender over-the-air software updater client.
 Mender: over-the-air updater for embedded Linux devices
 .
 Mender is an open source over-the-air (OTA) software updater for embedded
 Linux devices. Mender comprises a client running at the embedded device, as
 well as a server that manages deployments across many devices.
 .
 Embedded product teams often end up creating homegrown updaters
 at the last minute due to the need to fix bugs in field-deployed
 devices. However, the most important requirement for an embedded update
 process is robustness, for example loss of power at any time should not
 brick a device. This creates a challenge given the time constraints to
 develop and maintain a homegrown updater.
 .
 Mender aims to address this challenge with a robust and easy to use
 updater for embedded Linux devices, which is open source and available
 to anyone.
 .
 Robustness is ensured with atomic image-based deployments using a dual
 A/B rootfs partition layout. This makes it always possible to roll
 back to a working state, even when losing power at any time during the
 update process.
 .
 Ease of use is addressed with an intuitive UI, comprehensive documentation
 (https://docs.mender.io/), a meta layer for the Yocto Project
 (https://github.com/mendersoftware/meta-mender) for easy integration
 into existing environments, and high quality software (see the test
 coverage badge).
 .
 This repository contains the Mender client updater, which can be run in
 standalone mode (manually triggered through its command line interface)
 or managed mode (connected to the Mender server).
 .
 Mender not only provides the client-side updater, but also the backend and
 UI for managing deployments as open source. The Mender server is designed
 as a microservices architecture and comprises several repositories.
 .
 To start using Mender, we recommend that you begin with the Getting
 started section in the Mender documentation (https://docs.mender.io/).
 .
 In order to support rollback, the Mender client depends on integration
 with U-Boot and the partition layout. It is therefore most easily
 built as part of your Yocto Project image by using the meta layer for
 the Yocto Project (https://github.com/mendersoftware/meta-mender).

Package: nbd-client
Description-md5: 50b5081db709f9bc399b8b74366d1d8f
Description-en: Network Block Device protocol - client
 Network Block Device (NBD) is a client/server protocol that
 emulates a block device (such as a hard disk, a floppy, or a CD-ROM)
 over the network, thus giving the system the ability to swap over the
 network, or to use raw network disk space for other purposes.
 .
 However, writing to one Network Block Device from different clients
 simultaneously is not recommended, and would probably result in data
 loss. If you want multiple clients to share a remote resource, use a
 network file system such as NFS or Coda.
 .
 This package provides the client binary for NBD.

Package: ncbi-entrez-direct
Description-md5: 10c6a6866d4021f4e8969018b2d1adbc
Description-en: NCBI Entrez utilities on the command line
 Entrez Direct (EDirect) is an advanced method for accessing NCBI's set
 of interconnected databases (publication, sequence, structure, gene,
 variation, expression, etc.) from a terminal window or script.
 Functions take search terms from command-line arguments.  Individual
 operations are combined to build multi-step queries.  Record retrieval
 and formatting normally complete the process.
 .
 EDirect also provides an argument-driven function that simplifies the
 extraction of data from document summaries or other results that are
 returned in structured XML format.  This can eliminate the need for
 writing custom software to answer ad hoc questions.  Queries can move
 seamlessly between EDirect commands and UNIX utilities or scripts to
 perform actions that cannot be accomplished entirely within Entrez.

 NNCP is a package facilitating secure store-and-forward file and mail
 exchange.  It can be thought of as a modern UUCP with Internet smarts.
 .
 NNCP supports direct online communication over a LAN or Internet,
 scheduled communication, offline copies, streaming communication
 (pipes), and more.  It can therefore be used for air-gapped computers
 that might be communicated with by CD-ROM, tape, or USB stick.  It can
 also be used for intermittent or on-demand links, very slow or high
 latency links, etc.
 .
 NNCP can build up ad-hoc friend-to-friend (F2F) statically routed,
 darknet, delay-tolerant networks for fire-and-forget secure reliable
 files, file requests, Internet mail and commands transmission. All
 packets are integrity checked, end-to-end encrypted, explicitly
 authenticated by known participants public keys. Onion encryption is
 applied to relayed packets. Each node acts both as a client and server, can
 use push and poll behaviour model. Also there is multicasting areas support.

Package: notary
Description-md5: e711f233992770c0982664a996c25313
Description-en: tool for running and interacting with trusted collections
 Notary is a project that allows anyone to have trust over arbitrary
 collections of data.
 .
 The Notary project comprises a server (cmd/notary-server) and a client
 (cmd/notary) for running and interacting with trusted collections.
 .
 Notary aims to make the internet more secure by making it easy for people to
 publish and verify content. We often rely on TLS to secure our communications
 with a web server which is inherently flawed, as any compromise of the server
 enables malicious content to be substituted for the legitimate content.
 .
 With Notary, publishers can sign their content offline using keys kept highly
 secure. Once the publisher is ready to make the content available, they can
 push their signed trusted collection to a Notary Server.
 .
 Consumers, having acquired the publisher's public key through a secure
 channel, can then communicate with any notary server or (insecure) mirror,
 relying only on the publisher's key to determine the validity and integrity
 of the received content.
 .
 This package contains the binaries/tools.

    same container
  - Set HostConfig settings like network and memory controls that are
    not available when running container builds
  - Mount external files into the build that are not persisted as part
    of the final image (i.e. "secrets")
  - If there are no RUN commands in the Dockerfile, the container is
    created and committed, but never started.  The final image should be
    99.9% compatible with regular container builds, but bugs are always
    possible.

 The toolchain is composed of the following tools:
 1. spliced_bam2gff - a tool for converting sorted BAM
 files containing spliced alignments
 into GFF2 format. Each read will be represented as a distinct
 transcript. This tool comes handy when visualizing spliced
 reads at particular loci and to provide input to the rest
 of the toolchain.
 .
 2. cluster_gff - this tool takes a sorted GFF2 file as
 input and clusters together reads having similar
 exon/intron structure and creates a rough consensus
 of the clusters by taking the median of exon
 boundaries from all transcripts in the cluster.
 .
 3. polish_clusters - this tool takes the cluster
 definitions generated by cluster_gff and for each
 cluster creates an error corrected read by mapping
 all reads on the read with the median length
 and polishing it using racon. The polished reads
 can be mapped to the genome using minimap2 or GMAP.
 .
 4. collapse_partials - this tool takes GFFs generated
 by either cluster_gff or polish_clusters and filters
 out transcripts which are likely to be based on RNA
 degradation products from the 5' end. The tool clusters
 the input transcripts into "loci" by the 3' ends and
 discards transcripts which have a compatible transcripts
 in the loci with more exons.

Package: prometheus-pushgateway
Description-md5: 95fbeb244faa98192d9c460610063023
Description-en: Prometheus exporter for ephemereal jobs
 The Prometheus Pushgateway exists to allow ephemeral and batch jobs to expose
 their metrics to Prometheus. Since these kinds of jobs may not exist long
 enough to be scraped, they can instead push their metrics to a Pushgateway.
 The Pushgateway then exposes these metrics to Prometheus.

Package: protoc-gen-connect-go
Description-md5: 786e74ed3434cd7599964a5addbe237a
Description-en: Go implementation of Connect (protobuf plugin)
 Connect is a slim library for building browser and gRPC-compatible HTTP APIs.
 You write a short Protocol Buffer schema and implement your application logic,
 and Connect generates code to handle marshaling, routing, compression, and
 content type negotiation. It also generates an idiomatic, type-safe client.
 Handlers and clients support three protocols: gRPC, gRPC-Web, and Connect's own
 protocol.
 .
 The Connect protocol is a simple protocol that works over HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2.
 It takes the best portions of gRPC and gRPC-Web, including streaming, and
 packages them into a protocol that works equally well in browsers, monoliths,
 and microservices. Calling a Connect API is as easy as using curl.

Package: python3-locust
Description-md5: 911e441f2a6793c9ab945f6dce380f04
Description-en: Developer friendly load testing framework
 Locust is an easy to use, scriptable and scalable performance testing tool. You
 define the behaviour of your users in regular Python code, instead of using a
 clunky UI or domain specific language. This makes Locust infinitely expandable
 and very developer friendly.
 .
 Features:
 .
  * Write user test scenarios in plain-old Python -- If you want your users to
    loop, perform some conditional behaviour or do some calculations, you just
    use the regular programming constructs provided by Python. Locust runs every
    user inside its own greenlet (a lightweight process/coroutine). This enables
    you to write your tests like normal (blocking) Python code instead of having
    to use callbacks or some other mechanism. Because your scenarios are “just
    python” you can use your regular IDE, and version control your tests as
    regular code (as opposed to some other tools that use XML or binary
    formats).
  * Distributed & Scalable - supports hundreds of thousands of users -- Locust
    makes it easy to run load tests distributed over multiple machines. It is
    event-based (using gevent), which makes it possible for a single process to
    handle many thousands concurrent users. While there may be other tools that
    are capable of doing more requests per second on a given hardware, the low
    overhead of each Locust user makes it very suitable for testing highly
    concurrent workloads.
  * Web-based UI -- Locust has a user friendly web interface that shows the
    progress of your test in real-time. You can even change the load while the
    test is running. It can also be run without the UI, making it easy to use
    for CI/CD testing.
  * Can test any system -- Even though Locust primarily works with web
    sites/services, it can be used to test almost any system or protocol. Just
    write a client for what you want to test, or explore some created by the
    community.

 builtin libraries as they provide a similar interface to match, filter, and
 glob the file system. But they also include a number of features found in
 Bash's globbing such as backslash escaping, brace expansion, extended glob
 pattern groups, etc. They also add a number of new useful functions as well,
 such as globmatch which functions like fnmatch, but for paths.

 top of fnmatch and globmatch. It was originally written for Rummage, but split
 out into this project to be used by other projects that may find its approach
 useful.

Package: reposurgeon
Description-md5: 1b46c082d5403c85905efc120cbb2e94
Description-en: Tool for editing version-control repository history
 `reposurgeon` enables risky operations that version-control systems
 don't want to let you do, such as (a) editing past comments and metadata,
 (b) excising commits, (c) coalescing commits, and (d) removing files and
 subtrees from repo history. The original motivation for `reposurgeon`
 was to clean up artifacts created by repository conversions.
 .
 `reposurgeon` is also useful for scripting very high-quality
 conversions from Subversion.  It is better than `git-svn` at tag
 lifting, automatically cleaning up `cvs2svn` conversion artifacts,
 dealing with nonstandard repository layouts, recognizing branch
 merges, handling mixed-branch commits, and generally at coping with
 Subversion's many odd corner cases.  Normally Subversion repos should
 be analyzed at a rate of upwards of ten thousand commits per minute,
 though that rate can fall significantly on extremely large
 repositories.
 .
 An auxiliary program, `repotool`, performs various useful
 operations such as checkouts and tag listing in a VCS-independent
 manner.  Yet another, `repomapper`, assists in automatically preparing
 contributor maps of CVS and SVN repositories.
 .
 The `repocutter` program is available for some specialized operations on
 Subversion dumpfiles; it may be useful in extracting portions of
 particularly gnarly Subversion repositories for conversion with
 reposurgeon.
 .
 This distribution supports a generic conversion workflow using these
 tools, and includes a long-form manual "Repository Editing and
 Conversion With Reposurgeon" that describes how to use it.
 .
 The file `reposurgeon-git-aliases` can be appended to your `~/.gitconfig` to
 support working directly with action stamps in git.
 .
 Finally, an Emacs Lisp mode with useful functions for editing large
 comment message-boxes is included.

Package: restic

Description-en: backup program with multiple revisions, encryption and more
 restic is a program that does backups right and was designed with the following
 principles in mind:
    - Easy: Doing backups should be a frictionless process, otherwise you might
 be tempted to skip it.  Restic should be easy to configure and use, so
 that, in the event of a data loss, you can just restore it. Likewise,
 restoring data should not be complicated.
    - Fast: Backing up your data with restic should only be limited by your
 network or hard disk bandwidth so that you can backup your files every day.
 Nobody does backups if it takes too much time. Restoring backups should
 only transfer data that is needed for the files that are to be restored, so
 that this process is also fast.
    - Verifiable: Much more important than backup is restore, so restic enables
 you to easily verify that all data can be restored.
    - Secure: Restic uses cryptography to guarantee confidentiality and
 integrity of your data. The location the backup data is stored is assumed
 not to be a trusted environment (e.g. a shared space where others like
 system administrators are able to access your backups). Restic is
 built to secure your data against such attackers.
    - Efficient: With the growth of data, additional snapshots should only take
 the storage of the actual increment. Even more, duplicate data should be
 de-duplicated before it is actually written to the storage back end to save
 precious backup space.

Package: sia
Description-md5: ad065d9d74c6eb3eeeab33e17b67e849
Description-en: Blockchain-based marketplace for file storage
 Sia is a decentralized cloud storage platform aimed at giving users
 control of their data. Data is split into hundreds of erasure coded
 pieces and encrypted locally, and then each piece is uploaded to a
 separate host. A blockchain is used to create cryptographic contracts
 ensuring that hosts will only get paid if they actually store the
 data. Out of hundreds of hosts, only a fraction are required to
 recover the original file.
 .
 Anybody can join the network as a host and get income from the
 storage they contribute. This openness allows Sia to build and take
 advantage of a global network of small datacenters. Combined with
 advanced algorithms for storing and retrieving data, Sia is poised to
 be a highly competitive cloud storage platform. More information
 about the technology can be found on our website and in the 'doc'
 folder of the repo.
 .
 Sia is ready for use with small sums of money and non-critical files,
 but until the network has a more proven track record, we advise
 against using it as a sole means of storing important data.

Package: tar-split
Description-md5: 0a7073586375397f4634a2441b79a786
Description-en: tar archive assembly/disassembly
 Pristinely disassembling a tar archive, and stashing needed raw bytes and
 offsets to reassemble a validating original archive.
 .
 Eventually this should detect TARs that this is not possible with.
 .
 For example stored sparse files that have "holes" in them, will be read as a
 contiguous file, though the archive contents may be recorded in sparse format.
 Therefore when adding the file payload to a reassembled tar, to achieve
 identical output, the file payload would need be precisely re-sparsified. This
 is not something I seek to fix immediately, but would rather have an alert that
 precise reassembly is not possible. (see more
 http://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_node/Sparse-Formats.html)
 .
 Other caveat, while tar archives support having multiple file entries for the
 same path, we will not support this feature. If there are more than one entries
 with the same path, expect an err (like ErrDuplicatePath) or a resulting tar
 stream that does not validate your original checksum/signature.

Package: victoria-metrics
Description-md5: 501b1c659440c82b2a48c77598b94938
Description-en: fast, cost-effective and scalable time series database
 VictoriaMetrics is a fast, cost-effective and scalable time-series database.
 It can be used as long-term remote storage for Prometheus.
 .
 Prominent features:
  * Supports Prometheus querying API, so it can be used as Prometheus
    drop-in replacement in Grafana. VictoriaMetrics implements MetricsQL
    query language, which is inspired by PromQL.
  * Supports global query view. Multiple Prometheus instances may write
    data into VictoriaMetrics. Later this data may be used in a single query.
  * High performance and good scalability for both inserts and selects.
    Outperforms InfluxDB and TimescaleDB by up to 20x.
  * Uses 10x less RAM than InfluxDB when working with millions of unique time
    series (aka high cardinality).
  * Optimized for time series with high churn rate. Think about
    prometheus-operator metrics from frequent deployments in Kubernetes.
  * High data compression, so up to 70x more data points may be crammed into
    limited storage comparing to TimescaleDB.
  * Optimized for storage with high-latency IO and low IOPS (HDD and network
    storage in AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, etc).
  * A single-node VictoriaMetrics may substitute moderately sized clusters
    built with competing solutions such as Thanos, M3DB, Cortex, InfluxDB or
    TimescaleDB.
  * Easy operation:
    - VictoriaMetrics consists of a single small executable without external
      dependencies.
    - All the configuration is done via explicit command-line flags with
      reasonable defaults.
    - All the data is stored in a single directory pointed by
      -storageDataPath flag.
    - Easy and fast backups from instant snapshots to S3 or GCS with
      vmbackup / vmrestore.
    - Data migration between VictoriaMetrics, Prometheus and InfluxDB with
      vmctl.
  * Storage is protectedfrom corruption on unclean shutdown (i.e. OOM,
    hardware reset or kill -9) thanks to the storage architecture.
  * Supports metrics' scraping, ingestion and backfilling (#backfilling)
    via the following protocols:
    - Metrics from Prometheus exporters such as node_exporter.
    - Prometheus remote write API
    - InfluxDB line protocol
    - Graphite plaintext protocol with tags if -graphiteListenAddr is set.
    - OpenTSDB put message if -opentsdbListenAddr is set.
    - HTTP OpenTSDB /api/put requests if -opentsdbHTTPListenAddr is set.
    - /api/v1/import.
  * Ideally works with big amounts of time series data from Kubernetes, IoT
    sensors, connected cars, industrial telemetry, financial data and
    various Enterprise workloads.
  * Has open source cluster version.

Package: xxdiff
Description-md5: 16740c13d4a0ad8696745102d5c96da2
Description-en: graphical file/directory comparison and merge tool
 xxdiff is a powerful tool for viewing the differences between two or three
 files, or two directories, and can be used to produce a merged version.  The
 texts of the two or three files are presented side by side with their
 differences highlighted with colors for easy identification.  Among its
 features are:
 .
  * Compares two or three files, or two directories (shallow and recursive)
  * Horizontal highlighting of diffs
  * Interactive merges, previewing and saving of the resulting output
  * Unmerges CVS conflicts and displays two files, to help resolve conflicts
  * Fully customizable with a resource file
  * Features and output that ease integration with scripts
 .
 The scripts that accompany xxdiff can be found in the xxdiff-scripts package.

Package: xxdiff-scripts
Description-md5: 474ac068136e129f4a88fdfa6a1c534e
Description-en: graphical file/directory comparison and merge tool - scripts
 xxdiff is a powerful tool for viewing the differences between two or three
 files, or two directories, and can be used to produce a merged version.  The
 texts of the two or three files are presented side by side with their
 differences highlighted with colors for easy identification.
 .
 This package provides a number of scripts that are used to perform a variety of
 tasks that all involve getting user verification and feedback using the xxdiff
 graphical differences viewer.
 .
 For example, there are scripts to perform global renaming of strings within a
 large codebase, where each transformed file is viewed by the user with an
 xxdiff, accepted, rejected or merged changes written over the original file
 (making backups is supported).  Also, this infrastructure is mostly provided as
 modules, in order to allow users to write file transformations in Python and to
 leverage this interactive confirmation process.
 .
 There are also scripts that visualize diffs for a number of SCM systems, like
 CVS, Subversion, etc.  This package was born after a number of these useful
 scripts had sprouted, and it became apparent that sharing the common code for
 the scripts would be a great advantage to tools writers.
 .
 See documentation for a full list of the scripts and their role:

Package: xzdec
Description-md5: 30227ffce3f42144b3b624776f996bbf
Description-en: XZ-format compression utilities - tiny decompressors
 XZ is the successor to the Lempel-Ziv/Markov-chain Algorithm
 compression format, which provides memory-hungry but powerful
 compression (often better than bzip2) and fast, easy decompression.
 .
 This package provides the xzdec and lzmadec utilities, which write
 the decompressed version of a compressed file to standard output. The
 binaries are very small, so they can be easily stored on small media
 with some compressed files, and they are linked statically against
 liblzma so they can be used on machines without a compatible version
 of liblzma installed. However, they have:
 .
   * no compression support;
   * no support for writing to a file other than standard output;
   * no translated messages;
   * been optimized for size rather than speed.
 .
 For a full-featured xzcat command without these limitations, use
 the xz-utils package instead.
