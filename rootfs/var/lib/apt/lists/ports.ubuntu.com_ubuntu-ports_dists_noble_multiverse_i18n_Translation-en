Description-en: The Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide
 An in-depth exploration of the art of shell scripting.
 .
 This tutorial assumes no previous knowledge of scripting or
 programming, but progresses rapidly toward an intermediate/advanced
 level of instruction ... all the while sneaking in little snippets
 of UNIX(R) wisdom and lore. It serves as a textbook, a manual for
 self-study, and a reference and source of knowledge on shell
 scripting techniques. The exercises and heavily-commented examples
 invite active reader participation, under the premise that the only
 way to really learn scripting is to write scripts.
 .
 This book is suitable for classroom use as a general introduction to
 programming concepts.

Package: afio
Description-md5: ca88467cccd23b8f150ff01185566a6c
Description-en: archive file manipulation program
 Afio manipulates groups of files, copying them within or between
 filesystems and an afio archive.
 .
 Afio archives are portable as they contain only ASCII-formatted header
 information. Afio makes cpio-format archives.  Afio deals somewhat
 gracefully with input data corruption.  Afio supports multi-volume
 archives during interactive operation.  Afio can make compressed
 archives that are much safer than compressed tar or cpio archives.
 .
 Afio is best used as an `archive engine' in a backup script.

Description-en: Sound files for the roguelike game angband
 Angband is a single-player, text-based, dungeon simulation derived
 from the game Moria, which was in turn based on Rogue. It is
 often described as a "roguelike" game because the look and feel of
 the game is still quite similar to Rogue (though there are now graphical
 tiles available if you dislike ASCII gaming). Angband has been in more or
 less continuous development since the early 1990s.
 .
 Although angband is free, the sounds are under a non-commercial licence
 (Creative Commons BY-NC-SA) and are therefore considered non-free in Debian.
 Since the main game comes with no free sounds, install this package if you
 want sound.

Package: distributed-net
Description-md5: 477da522b2f82ac0fc58fa899167257f
Description-en: client to donate unused CPU cycles to distributed.net
 Donate your extra CPU cycles to a worthy cause!
 .
 distributed.net started in 1997 as a project whose purpose was to win a
 series of contests sponsored by RSA Data Security Inc., to crack their RC5
 encryption by brute-force methods. These contests were meant to show
 governments of nations such as the United States, who limit exports or
 use of cryptography, that the standards allowed are too weak for general
 use.
 .
 Since this time, distributed.net's focus has changed from solely
 cracking RSA's RC5 and DES projects to working on more diverse
 distributed computing problems.
 .
 The ongoing projects are RC5-72 and Optimal Golomb Rulers (28-mark), the
 latter of which has practical applications in science. There are also a
 number of other projects which are either periodic or upcoming. You may
 choose which project you wish to participate in.
 .
 Installing this package will allow unused CPU cycles on your computer to
 contribute to cracking the code. There should be no noticeable slowdown of
 your system, since the client runs niced, and only uses CPU time when
 your computer would otherwise be idle.

Package: dynare-matlab
Description-md5: 90e8fcabb135fcf60e09f0be51774946
Description-en: MATLAB support for Dynare
 Dynare is a software platform for handling a wide class of economic models, in
 particular dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) and overlapping
 generations (OLG) models. The models solved by Dynare include those relying on
 the rational expectations hypothesis, wherein agents form their expectations
 about the future in a way consistent with the model. But Dynare is also able
 to handle models where expectations are formed differently: on one extreme,
 models where agents perfectly anticipate the future; on the other extreme,
 models where agents have limited rationality or imperfect knowledge of the
 state of the economy and, hence, form their expectations through a learning
 process. In terms of types of agents, models solved by Dynare can incorporate
 consumers, productive firms, governments, monetary authorities, investors and
 financial intermediaries. Some degree of heterogeneity can be achieved by
 including several distinct classes of agents in each of the aforementioned
 agent categories.
 .
 Dynare offers a user-friendly and intuitive way of describing these models. It
 is able to perform simulations of the model given a calibration of the model
 parameters and is also able to estimate these parameters given a dataset. In
 practice, the user will write a text file containing the list of model
 variables, the dynamic equations linking these variables together, the
 computing tasks to be performed and the desired graphical or numerical
 outputs.
 .
 This package is only useful to users having MATLAB installed on their
 machine. It contains the source of the MEX files and will recompile them using
 the existing MATLAB installation.

 Google's Android SDK Platform-Tools is a component for the Android SDK. It
 includes tools that interface with the Android platform, such as adb,
 fastboot, and systrace. These tools are required for Android app development.
 They're also needed if you want to unlock your device bootloader and flash
 it with a new system image.
 .
 Although some new features in these tools are available only for recent
 versions of Android, the tools are backward compatible, so you need only
 one version of the SDK Platform-Tools.

Description-en: Android SDK Documentation from Google
 This package will download the Android SDK Documentation from Google and
 create a Debian package.  This package also aims to strip out all calls to
 the networking, including tracking services like Google Analytics and
 Doubleclick. These documentation files still require the Google "jsapi",
 which is only available by fetching it each time from
 http://www.google.com/jsapi.  This package forces it to use https://, but
 otherwise, these docs have to phone home in order for any of the javascript
 to work.
 .
 WARNING: Installing this Debian package causes docs-24_r01.zip to be
 downloaded from https://dl.google.com and/or from other suggested
 mirrors.  Also, since Google is often blocked in China, the install
 process will try again on Chinese mirrors if the Google central
 download repo is not available.  Since the zipball is checked against
 the embedded SHA1 checksum, the install will fail if the mirror
 contains a corrupted version.

 Abstract Interpretation data structures and algorithms, such as control-flow
 graphs, fixpoint iterators, numerical abstract domains, etc. IKOS is
 independent of a particular programming language.

Description-en: Solves large sparse linear systems with algebraic multigrid method
 AMG is one of the most effective iterative methods for solution of equation
 systems arising, for example, from discretizing PDEs on unstructured grids. The
 method can be used as a black-box solver for various computational problems,
 since it does not require any information about the underlying geometry. AMG is
 often used not as a standalone solver but as a preconditioner within an
 iterative solver (e.g. Conjugate Gradients, BiCGStab, or GMRES).
 .
 AMGCL builds the AMG hierarchy on a CPU and then transfers it to one of the
 provided backends. This allows for transparent acceleration of the solution
 phase with help of OpenCL, CUDA, or OpenMP technologies. Users may provide
 their own backends which enables tight integration between AMGCL and the user
 code.
 .
 AMG is a header-only C++ library, with the headers provided by this package.

 general purpose computation.
 .
 The cuSPARSE library contains a set of basic linear algebra subroutines used
 for handling sparse matrices. It is implemented on top of the NVIDIA CUDA
 runtime and is designed to be called from C and C++. The library routines can
 be classified into four categories:
  * Level 1: operations between a vector in sparse format and a vector in dense
 format
  * Level 2: operations between a matrix in sparse format and a vector in dense
 format
  * Level 3: operations between a matrix in sparse format and a set of vectors
 in dense format
  * Conversion: operations that allow conversion between different matrix
 formats
 .
 This package contains the cuSPARSE runtime library.

Description-md5: 4d44009005870b8473610afb57050108
Description-en: CUDA Templates for Linear Algebra Subroutines
 CUTLASS is a collection of CUDA C++ template abstractions for implementing
 high-performance matrix-matrix multiplication (GEMM) and related computations
 at all levels and scales within CUDA. It incorporates strategies for
 hierarchical decomposition and data movement similar to those used to implement
 cuBLAS and cuDNN. CUTLASS decomposes these "moving parts" into reusable,
 modular software components abstracted by C++ template classes. Primitives for
 different levels of a conceptual parallelization hierarchy can be specialized
 and tuned via custom tiling sizes, data types, and other algorithmic policy.
 The resulting flexibility simplifies their use as building blocks within custom
 kernels and applications.
 .
 To support a wide variety of applications, CUTLASS provides extensive support
 for mixed-precision computations, providing specialized data-movement and
 multiply-accumulate abstractions for half-precision floating point (FP16),
 BFloat16 (BF16), Tensor Float 32 (TF32), single-precision floating point
 (FP32), FP32 emulation via tensor core instruction, double-precision
 floating point (FP64) types, integer data types (4b and 8b), and binary
 data types (1b). CUTLASS demonstrates warp-synchronous matrix multiply
 operations targeting the programmable, high-throughput Tensor Cores
 implemented by NVIDIA's Volta, Turing, Ampere, and Hopper architectures.
 .
 This is a header-only library.

Package: libdemeter-perl
Description-md5: 61bcaabdcd578f132064042eed689bdf
Description-en: comprehensive XAS data analysis system using Feff and Ifeffit or Larch
 Demeter provides an object oriented interface to the EXAFS data analysis
 capabilities of the popular and powerful Ifeffit package and its successor
 Larch. Given that the Ifeffit and Larch APIs involve streams of text
 commands, this package is, at heart, a code generator. Many methods of this
 package return text. All actual interaction with Ifeffit or Larch is handled
 through a single method, dispose, which is described below. The internal
 structure of this package involves accumulating text in a scalar variable
 through successive calls to the various code generating methods. This text is
 then disposed to Ifeffit, to Larch, to a file, or elsewhere. The outward
 looking methods organize all of the complicated interactions of your data
 with Ifeffit or Larch.
 .
 This package is aimed at many targets. It can be the back-end of a graphical
 data analysis program, providing the glue between the on-screen
 representation of the fit and the actual command executed by Ifeffit or
 Larch. It can be used for one-off data analysis chores -- indeed most of the
 examples that come with the package can be reworked into useful one-off
 scripts. It can also be the back-end to sophisticated data analysis chores
 such as high-throughout data processing and analysis or complex physical
 modeling.

Package: libnucleotidelikelihoodcore0
Description-md5: 2beeba75259cb25079c34eef520b0bde
Description-en: implementation of LikelihoodCore for nucleotides used by beast-mcmc
 BEAST is a cross-platform program for Bayesian MCMC analysis of molecular
 sequences. It is entirely orientated towards rooted, time-measured
 phylogenies inferred using strict or relaxed molecular clock models. It
 can be used as a method of reconstructing phylogenies but is also a
 framework for testing evolutionary hypotheses without conditioning on a
 single tree topology. BEAST uses MCMC to average over tree space, so that
 each tree is weighted proportional to its posterior probability. Included
 is a simple to use user-interface program for setting up standard
 analyses and a suit of programs for analysing the results.
 .
 This package provides an implementation of LikelihoodCore for nucleotides
 that calls native methods for maximum speed.

Description-en: find issues in MP3 files and help to solve them
 MP3 Diags is a GUI-based application that allows end-users to identify issues
 with their MP3 files, fix some of the issues and make other changes, like
 adding track information. It also allows user to "look inside" an MP3 file.
 .
 Unlike some programs that are designed to deal with a single topic (like
 fixing VBR headers or adding cover art), MP3 Diags is a one stop solution
 that identifies more than 50 different issues in MP3 files and provides the
 means to fix many of them.
 .
 Some of the more important issues that are found:
 .
  * Broken tags / headers / audio.
  * Duplicate tags / headers.
  * Incorrect placement of tags / headers (ID3V2, ID3V1, LAME, Xing, etc).
  * Low quality audio.
  * Missing VBR header.
  * Missing track info / cover art.
  * Broken track info / cover art.
  * Missing normalization data.
  * Character encoding issues (for languages other than English).
 .
 Some of the fixes and changes that MP3 Diags can do:
 .
  * Adding / fixing track info, including album cover; information can be
    retrieved from several sources: Internet, clipboard, file name, local
    files, and (obviously) keyboard.
  * Correcting files that show incorrect song duration.
  * Correcting files in which the player cannot seek correctly.
  * Converting characters for non-English names.
  * Adding composer name to the artist field, for players that don't handle
    the composer field.
  * Renaming files based on their fields.
  * Changing word case for track info.

Description-md5: 136f2157dc662607863d657b37a31ab7
Description-en: Open-source re-implementation of RollerCoaster Tycoon 2
 OpenRCT2 is an open-source re-implementation of RollerCoaster Tycoon 2
 (RCT2). The gameplay revolves around building and maintaining an
 amusement park containing attractions, shops and facilities. The player
 must try to make a profit and maintain a good park reputation whilst
 keeping the guests happy. OpenRCT2 allows for both scenario and sandbox
 play. Scenarios require the player to complete a certain objective in a
 set time limit whilst sandbox allows the player to build a more flexible
 park with optionally no restrictions or finance.
 .
 RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 was originally written by Chris Sawyer in x86
 assembly and is the sequel to RollerCoaster Tycoon. The engine was based
 on Transport Tycoon, an older game which also has an equivalent
 open-source project, OpenTTD. OpenRCT2 attempts to provide everything
 from RCT2 as well as many improvements and additional features, some of
 these include support for modern platforms, an improved interface,
 improved guest and staff AI, more editing tools, increased limits, and
 cooperative multiplayer. It also re-introduces mechanics from RollerCoaster
 Tycoon that were not present in RollerCoaster Tycoon 2. Some of those
 include; mountain tool in-game, the "have fun" objective, launched coasters
 (not passing-through the station) and several buttons on the toolbar.

Package: python-pycuda-doc
Description-md5: 4b4f2b1e8b32879eefe98c99f3a598ba
Description-en: module to access Nvidia‘s CUDA computation API (documentation)
 PyCUDA lets you access Nvidia‘s CUDA parallel computation API from Python.
 Several wrappers of the CUDA API already exist–so what’s so special about
 PyCUDA?
  * Object cleanup tied to lifetime of objects. This idiom, often called
    RAII in C++, makes it much easier to write correct, leak- and crash-free
    code.  PyCUDA knows about dependencies, too, so (for example) it won’t
    detach from a context before all memory allocated in it is also freed.
  * Convenience. Abstractions like pycuda.driver.SourceModule and
    pycuda.gpuarray.GPUArray make CUDA programming even more convenient than
    with Nvidia’s C-based runtime.
  * Completeness. PyCUDA puts the full power of CUDA’s driver API at your
    disposal, if you wish.
  * Automatic Error Checking. All CUDA errors are automatically translated
    into Python exceptions.
  * Speed. PyCUDA’s base layer is written in C++, so all the niceties
    above are virtually free.
  * Helpful Documentation.

Package: python3-amgcl
Description-md5: ecbb9c7c4315244c6b65581f6b220a1f
Description-en: Solves large sparse linear systems with algebraic multigrid method
 AMG is one of the most effective iterative methods for solution of equation
 systems arising, for example, from discretizing PDEs on unstructured grids. The
 method can be used as a black-box solver for various computational problems,
 since it does not require any information about the underlying geometry. AMG is
 often used not as a standalone solver but as a preconditioner within an
 iterative solver (e.g. Conjugate Gradients, BiCGStab, or GMRES).
 .
 AMGCL builds the AMG hierarchy on a CPU and then transfers it to one of the
 provided backends. This allows for transparent acceleration of the solution
 phase with help of OpenCL, CUDA, or OpenMP technologies. Users may provide
 their own backends which enables tight integration between AMGCL and the user
 code.

 Statistical methods for the modeling and monitoring of time series of
 counts, proportions and categorical data, as well as for the modeling of
 continuous-time point processes of epidemic phenomena.
 .
 The monitoring methods focus on aberration detection in count data time
 series from public health surveillance of communicable diseases, but
 applications could just as well originate from environmetrics,
 reliability engineering, econometrics, or social sciences. The package
 implements many typical outbreak detection procedures such as the
 (improved) Farrington algorithm, or the negative binomial GLR-CUSUM
 method of Höhle and Paul (2008) <doi:10.1016/j.csda.2008.02.015>. A novel
 CUSUM approach combining logistic and multinomial logistic modeling is
 also included. The package contains several real-world data sets, the
 ability to simulate outbreak data, and to visualize the results of the
 monitoring in a temporal, spatial or spatio-temporal fashion. A recent
 overview of the available monitoring procedures is given by Salmon et al.
 (2016) <doi:10.18637/jss.v070.i10>.
 .
 For the retrospective analysis of epidemic spread, the package provides
 three endemic-epidemic modeling frameworks with tools for visualization,
 likelihood inference, and simulation. hhh4() estimates models for
 (multivariate) count time series following Paul and Held (2011)
 <doi:10.1002/sim.4177> and Meyer and Held (2014)
 <doi:10.1214/14-AOAS743>. twinSIR() models the
 susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) event history of a fixed
 population, e.g, epidemics across farms or networks, as a multivariate
 point process as proposed by Höhle (2009) <doi:10.1002/bimj.200900050>.
 twinstim() estimates self-exciting point process models for a
 spatio-temporal point pattern of infective events, e.g., time-stamped
 geo-referenced surveillance data, as proposed by Meyer et al. (2012)
 <doi:10.1111/j.1541-0420.2011.01684.x>. A recent overview of the

 uploads to the Android revision control system, and automates parts of the
 Android development workflow. Repo is not meant to replace Git, only to make
 it easier to work with Git in the context of Android. The repo command is an
 executable Python script that you can put anywhere in your path. In working
 with the Android source files, you will use Repo for across-network
 operations. For example, with a single Repo command you can download files
 from multiple repositories into your local working directory.
 .
 repo is an unusual tool because it downloads all of its own Python modules
 using GPG-signed git tags, and stores those files as part of the project that
 it is working with.  So this package just provides the wrapper script, which
 provides the GPG signing keys for verifying that the correct Python code was
 downloaded.

Description-en: Speech synthesizer - test tools
 RHVoice uses statistical parametric synthesis. It relies on existing open
 source speech technologies (mainly HTS and related software).
 .
 Voices are built from recordings of natural speech. They have small footprints,
 because only statistical models are stored on users' computers. And though
 the voices lack the naturalness of the synthesizers which generate speech
 by combining segments of the recordings themselves, they are still very
 intelligible and resemble the speakers who recorded the source material.
 .
 Initially, RHVoice could speak only Russian. Now it also supports English,
 Esperanto and Georgian. In theory, it is possible to implement support for
 other languages, if all the necessary resources can be found or created.

 SiSU is a lightweight markup based, command line oriented, document
 structuring, publishing and search framework for document collections.
 .
 With minimal preparation of a plain-text, (UTF-8) file, using its native
 markup syntax in your text editor of choice, SiSU can generate various
 document formats (most of which share a common object numbering system for
 locating content), including plain text, HTML, XHTML, XML, EPUB, OpenDocument
 text (ODF:ODT), LaTeX, PDF files, and populate an SQL database with objects
 (roughly paragraph-sized chunks) so searches may be performed and matches
 returned with that degree of granularity: your search criteria is met by these
 documents and at these locations within each document. Object numbering is
 particularly suitable for "published" works (finalized texts as opposed to
 works that are frequently changed or updated) for which it provides a fixed
 means of reference of content. Document outputs also share semantic meta-data
 provided.
 .
 SiSU also provides concordance files, document content certificates and
 manifests of generated output.
 .
 man pages, and interactive help are provided.
 .
 Dependencies for additional features are taken care of in sisu related

Package: snaphu
Description-md5: bd83ead653bb3db50cb0e6dcb869f8bb
Description-en: Statistical-Cost, Network-Flow Algorithm for 2D Phase Unwrapping
 Two-dimensional phase unwrapping is the process of recovering
 unambiguous phase data from a 2-D array of phase values known only
 modulo 2pi rad.
 .
 There are many applications, like Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI),
 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), fringe pattern analysis, tomography
 and spectroscopy, which as part of their fundamental operation depend
 upon the extraction of a phase signal from their input image. Usually
 the phase is available in a form that suffers from 2-pi phase jumps
 due to the use of the mathematical arctangent function, which produces
 an inherently wrapped output. This wrapped phase is unusable until the
 phase discontinuities are removed.
 .
 SNAPHU is an implementation of the Statistical-cost, Network-flow
 Algorithm for Phase Unwrapping particularly suitable for SAR
 interferometry applications. This algorithm poses phase unwrapping as
 a maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimation problem, the
 objective of which is to compute the most likely unwrapped solution
 given the observable input data. Because the statistics relating the
 input data to the solution depend on the measured quantity, SNAPHU
 incorporates three built-in statistical models, for topography data,
 deformation data, and smooth generic data. The posed optimization
 problem is solved approximately with use of network-flow techniques.
 .
 As SNAPHU uses an iterative optimization procedure, its execution time
 depends on the difficulty of the interferogram. In single-tile mode
 the required memory is on the order of 100 MB per 1000000 pixels in
 the input interferogram.

Package: speech-dispatcher-ivona
Description-md5: 86870f9edb7fda6696c749808c9ab8ad
Description-en: Speech Dispatcher: Ivona output module
 Speech Dispatcher provides a device independent layer for speech synthesis.
 It supports various software and hardware speech synthesizers as
 backends and provides a generic layer for synthesizing speech and
 playing back PCM data via those different backends to applications.
 .
 Various high level concepts like enqueueing vs. interrupting speech and
 application specific user configurations are implemented in a device
 independent way, therefore freeing the application programmer from
 having to yet again reinvent the wheel.
 .
 This package contains the output module for the Ivona speech synthesizer,
 which needs to be installed separately.

Package: speech-dispatcher-rhvoice
Description-md5: 9773724ef643256946a9b4625a63b5d4
Description-en: RHVoice speech synthesizer - speech dispatcher module
 RHVoice uses statistical parametric synthesis. It relies on existing open
 source speech technologies (mainly HTS and related software).
 .
 Voices are built from recordings of natural speech. They have small footprints,
 because only statistical models are stored on users' computers. And though
 the voices lack the naturalness of the synthesizers which generate speech
 by combining segments of the recordings themselves, they are still very
 intelligible and resemble the speakers who recorded the source material.
 .
 Initially, RHVoice could speak only Russian. Now it also supports English,
 Esperanto and Georgian. In theory, it is possible to implement support for
 other languages, if all the necessary resources can be found or created.
 .
 This package contains the speech dispatcher module to use RHVoice

 "sql.[upstream version].standalone" will invoke a specific version of
 Oracle SQL Developer Command-Line, "sql.[upstram version]" will invoke
 either the standalone or bundled Oracle SQL Developer Command-Line version

Package: tome
Description-md5: 9efcf47839037501aa7357051f1287d3
Description-en: single-player text-based roguelike dungeon simulation game
 Tome, short for Troubles of Middle Earth, is a single-player,
 text-based, dungeon simulation derived from the game angband, which
 in turn is derived from the older game Moria, which was in turn based
 on Rogue. It is often described as a "roguelike" game because the
 look and feel of the game is still quite similar to Rogue.
 .
 In tome, the  player may choose from a number of races and classes
 when creating a character, and then "run" that character over a
 period of days, weeks, even months, attempting to win the game by
 defeating Morgoth, who lurks somewhere in  the depths of the dungeon.
 .
 The ultimate goal of the game is to develop a character strong enough
 to defeat Morgoth, who resides on dungeon level 100. Upon doing so,
 you will receive the exalted status of "winner" and your character may
 retire.
 .
 The first main difference from Angband a new player to ToME will need
 to be aware of is that it has implemented a skills based system where
 instead of the  adventurer automatically improving in their abilities
 as they become more experienced, they get 5 skill points to spend on
 their character's abilities and can therefore customise what type of
 character they play. See the skills help file for details
 .
 The second major difference is that the main dungeon from Angband has
 been split  into 4 "dungeons", each of which cover a different
 portion of the dungeon's  levels. Note that not all of the places are
 actually "dungeons" - some are caves, forests, etc.
 .
 The third main difference between Vanilla Angband and ToME is the
 difference  in character classes and races, as well as a very
 different  magic system. ToME also offers the player the ability to
 undertake a series of  quests. It is not required for any adventurer
 to undertake  the fixed  quests, but they can result in some nice
 rewards.
 .
 Morgoth was 'the Dark Enemy of Middle-Earth' during its First Age. He
 was banished by the Valar (offspring of Eru, "god" of J.R.R.
 Tolkien's world) at the end of the First Age and thus never appears
 in The Lord of the Rings, set during the Third Age. Sauron, who does
 figure into those tales, was the most powerful of his servants. Read
 Tolkien's 'The Silmarillion' for more on the legends of Middle-Earth.
 Angband is a reference to Morgoth's "prison of iron."

Description-md5: 57f4018681a35e8477bb6cfd59d27ec8
Description-en: Threaded USENET news reader, based on rn (4.0 beta test)
 trn is a threaded news reader with a long history, descended from Larry
 Wall's rn (part of the second generation of newsreaders).  It has a
 powerful full screen text mode user interface, where most actions are
 available at the press of a single key.  It is highly configurable.
 .
 This version of trn reads news from a news server via NNTP (the Network
 News Transfer Protocol).  You must have a news server available - large
 sites usually provide a site-wide server.
 .
 If you install a news server on your system (either containing just
 local newsgroups or with a partial or full USENET feed) you can
 configure trn to access it.  In this case you will also need to install
 an appropriate 'inews' package for local posting.
 .
 This is a separate package from trn because trn 4.0 has enough
 substantial changes in its default behaviour (for instance, the group
 selector is new in 4.0) that some users prefer to stay with an older
 version of trn.

Description-en: RNA sequence analysis
 The Vienna RNA Package consists of a C code library and several
 stand-alone programs for the prediction and comparison of RNA secondary
 structures. It is developed and maintained by the group of Ivo Hofacker
 in Vienna.
 .
 RNA secondary structure prediction through energy minimization is the
 most used function in the package. It provides three kinds of dynamic
 programming algorithms for structure prediction:
  * the minimum free energy algorithm of (Zuker & Stiegler 1981) which
    yields a single optimal structure,
  * the partition function algorithm of (McCaskill 1990) which calculates
    base pair probabilities in the thermodynamic ensemble, and the
    suboptimal folding algorithm of (Wuchty et.al 1999) which generates
    all suboptimal structures within a given energy range of the optimal
    energy.
 .
 For secondary structure comparison, the package contains several
 measures of distance (dissimilarities) using either string alignment or
 tree-editing (Shapiro & Zhang 1990). Finally, is provided an algorithm
 to design sequences with a predefined structure (inverse folding).
 The RNAforester package is a tool for aligning RNA secondary structures
 and it's user interface integrates to those of the tools of the
 Vienna RNA package.
